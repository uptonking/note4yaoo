- ## CSS responsive table
  - https://codepen.io/scottjehl/pen/abJrPOP
  - here's something I've been trying to do for at least 10 years!
  - A CSS-only responsive table with fixed column & row headers, inside a layout, with scroll snapping!
  - Works in: Firefox, Safari (iOS & Mac), Chrome (Mobile & Desktop), Edge
- There are some bugs related to interaction of position:sticky & scroll-snap in Chromium implementation
  - The zoom-in, zoom-out may be just a trigger to recalculate the snap positions leading to odd interaction with now stickily position header.
- I built a POC for a no tables version too
  - https://codepen.io/jonnyburch/pen/NWqrVdp
- Allowing overflow is one of the shortest technique to make tables responsive.

- ## I've reworked my Animated Gradient Border @CodePen demo to support non-Houdini browsers.
- https://twitter.com/bramus/status/1407332309532131341
  - Non-Houdini Browsers requires lots of extra code
  - It's not possible to feature detect support for @property
  - https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/XWMwPgO?editors=0110
  - 动态渐变色的边框
- To cater for the latter I had to StackOverflow my way into some nasty @​supports and @​media combination to target Chromium only. Ugh!

  - 页面内容区的顶部，会自动滑动到当前文章标题的位置
- It's a visually cool tech demo, but it's also introduces countless accessibility issues. 
  - For instance, locking should be disabled if there isn't enough screen real estate to display the content.
  - Screen design vs Page design 👌 We don’t design pages, we design screens and interactions.

- ##  `<datalist>` HTML element - useful for adding input suggestions with 0 javascript
- https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1260199927856001024
- I learned “the opposite”. 
  - I once tried to render ~100.000 options in a datalist using nextjs. 
  - Only to see each key press taking 5 secs to show 😂. 
  - Then I thought “maybe I need something else”. 
  - But datalist is awesome (in fact I would find it a lot harder to do that in js).
- Now try to put a image!!!... Don't work!
- `<datalist>` is well supported on mobile too. The only downside is that they are hard to style
- This is a similar idea to the `<optgroup>` tag

- ## Made a 10 line polyfill for flexbox gap.
- https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1244679626162450432
  - You can use it just like normal CSS properties. No extra wrappers around each item, or spacer elements needed. 
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/gallant-monad-p8jpv
  - CSS custom properties are super powerful!
  - `<div class="flex" style="--gap: 10px; ">`

- I made a quick demo sometime ago that demonstrates how you can change a property's value depending on whether or not a custom property was space-toggled.

- Done using Moti by @FernandoTheRojo powered by Reanimated2 by @swmansion & @kzzzf , built with @expo .

- ## project || prototype starter styles:
- https://twitter.com/argyleink/status/1371850967822520333
  - normalize box sizing
  - zero out margins
  - document & body fill viewport
  - use OS system font
  - https://codepen.io/uptonking/pen/QWGRyrX
  - 简单的落地页，文字水平竖直居中
- there's more to reset and/or normalize in a page, but it can get complex quickly and tradeoffs start to happen. 
  - the above is generically stable for my projects; a sturdy foundation.
- Not fond of the `position: relative` by default 
  - because I’ve often needed to break out of 2-3 ancestors to absolutely position something relative to their 3th or 4th ancestor. 
  - In React Native you can’t do that, so you have to change your structure significantly instead.

- ## New CSS @​scroll-timeline demo!

  - Experimental technology: Chrome with “Experimental Web Platform Features” enabled only for now
  - https://codepen.io/bramus/pen/GRNNjqz
- While we translate the `<figure>` elements on scroll, they're not the drivers of the animation. Instead, it's the position of their parent `<section>` that controls their animation progress (e.g. “Element-based Offsets”)

- ## You can create carousel using 2 lines of CSS

  - [Fluid typography with CSS clamp](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/fluid-typography-with-css-clamp)
- I’m a big fan of clamp()
  - it’s decent at doing what I like to do the most with CSS: 
  - let the browser do its job with some hints at how to do it. 
  - It also provides just the right amount of control, which is handy for layout elements, too.

- ## A table that has a sticky header *and* a sticky first-column. 
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1361741382759636993
  - Pure CSS solution too, via `position: sticky` and some clever stacking orders. No JS required!
  - [A table with both a sticky header and a sticky first column](https://css-tricks.com/a-table-with-both-a-sticky-header-and-a-sticky-first-column/)

- That is cool. But I hoped for an svg export though.
-  I poked at it and it’s built using standard HTML nodes rather than SVG, so it makes sense that it can only export png

- ## Properties like `z-index` can be used in your transitions and keyframe animations!

- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1357033108898410496
  - https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/QWGWXPz
- Because it's `clip-path` , it can be applied to your images, HTML nodes, anything!
  - No more weird border hacks for basic shapes

- ## Focus outlines are important for accessibility, but they can't be rounded. Simulate 'em with box-shadow!
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1356713502954635274
  - https://codepen.io/joshwcomeau/pen/LYbEQMa
- Don't forget a little dash of `border: 2px solid transparent` for Windows High Contrast Mode support!
- I remember hearing from @adamwathan this wasn't great for accessibility (in high-contrast mode on Windows or something?)
  - It’s totally ok but just have to make sure you don’t use `outline: none` to hide the browser focus style. 
  - Use something like `outline: 2px dotted transparent` instead, invisible to regular users but WHC will ignore transparent and show a real color

  - https://codepen.io/kassandrasanch/pen/oNzzMjr?editors=0100
- And I figured out one little difference between A and B. 
  - B have a rounded corners on bottom! 
  - so i check on your code, you made that rounded corner. 
  - So I guess B is Art and A is image

- 不要使用display:table-cell，表格布局在频繁操作动态样式时性能差
- 使用负值margin
  - http://jsfiddle.net/6eGdN
  - 通过父边框挡住子边框实现，或全部显示子边框

```css
    div.gridcontainer {
      width: 7/86px;
      line-height: 0;
    }

    div.griditem {
      display: inline-block;
      border: 1px solid black;
      width: 18px;
      height: 18px;
      margin-left: -1px;
      margin-bottom: -1px;
    }
```

- 使用父边框上左，使用子边框右下，也可交换

```css
  div.gridcontainer {
    width: 76px;
    line-height: 0;
    border: solid black;
    border-width: 1px 0 0 1px;
  }

  div.griditem {
    display: inline-block;
    border: solid black;
    border-width: 0 1px 1px 0;
    width: 18px;
    height: 18px;
  }
```

- use box-shadow instead of using border 
  - https://codepen.io/savehansson/pen/rsIEp
- add a left and bottom border to the ul and drop it from the li
