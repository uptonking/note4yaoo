## roadmap

- We shipped Hooks on time, but weâ€™re regrouping Concurrent Mode and Suspense for Data Fetching into a single release that we intend to release later this year
- We (2018) plan to split the rollout of new React features into the following milestones:
  - React 16.6 with Suspense for Code Splitting (already shipped)
  - A minor 16.x release with React Hooks (~Q1 2019)
  - A minor 16.x release with Concurrent Mode (~Q2 2019)
  - A minor 16.x release with Suspense for Data Fetching (~mid 2019)
