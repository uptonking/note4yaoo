- ## how do people handle functions that can throw in typescript? 
- https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1423404151149580292
  - half-considering starting to use an Either type of returning result | Error, donâ€™t want to rely on just remembering which functions are throwy
- In majority of the cases it should be fine, but in some weird cases you might encounter some of the system errors `RangeError` or `TypeError` to name a few. Which makes me think exhaustively typing all the possible errors  is impossible.
- I would even recommend creating a simple `Err` class for the error side of it's a logical error and not an actual unrecoverable error. Switching our parser to our own error type was a massive perf boost (somewhere around 100x for us)

- ## how do you type a memoize function that accepts an arbitrary length of arbitrarily-typed arguments?

  - we have a winner! guardian alumni network to the rescue 
  - `type Fn<T extends any[]> = (...args: T) => any; `
