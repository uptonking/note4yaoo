- ## üå≤ [Hierarchical Structures in PostgreSQL (2020) | Hacker News_202106](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27631765)
- A great overview of the pros and cons of different approaches is given in [Models for hierarchical data | PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/models-for-hierarchical-data)

- many RDBMS's have gotten support for recursive CTE's as of recently. It's definitely not a niche(ÈíàÂØπÁâπÂÆöÂ∞èÁæ§‰ΩìÁöÑ) feature anymore.
  - Recursive CTEs are almost never what you want. They're the database equivalent of pointer-chasing in code. If you design your schema such that you need a recursive CTE to query it, be prepared for bad performance unless your CTE only ever does a handful of iterations over a handful of rows.
  - I like paths for representing hierarchy, but closure tables can also be a good idea, depending on what you're modelling and how you query it.

- I'm a big fan of the nested set representation. 
  - It hits the sweet spot of compactness and expressivity - queries for parents, children, ancestors and descendants are simple integer comparison and pretty fast with the right indices. 
  - The only downside is that this requires updates of a large number of rows whenever the tree changes (not all rows though). If you have a sharded table that could be problematic.

- Most hierarchies are shallow in practice. Keep it simple.
  - tl; dr: I agree and healthy human organizations should never scale beyond ~5 degrees of hierarchy, which is totally manageable via basic recursive JOINs in a RDBMS without fancy stored procedures or graph theory.

- This is cool - I hadn't seen the materialized view + CTE trick before, or the ltree extension. 
  - I've implemented this in the past using the classic adjacency list, materialized path or nested sets mechanisms - all by using Django Treebeard, which offers a very robust implementation of all three of them
- [django-treebeard ‚Äî django-treebeard 4.7 documentation](https://django-treebeard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - Includes 3 different tree implementations with the same API: Adjacency List, Materialized Path, Nested Sets

- Most datasets have relationships forming a graph, but few need to be analyzed as a graph. Graph databases specialize for the latter usecase, with large datasets.
  - But you could always traverse graphs with recursive SQL ‚Äî it‚Äôs just less pleasant, and perhaps less performant ‚Äî but often that‚Äôs all you need (and often people confuse having a graph relationship with needing a graph-specialized database)

- This is use case dependent, but one of my favorite methods for implementing e.g. threaded comments is closure tables

- ## üå≤ [Representing Trees in PostgreSQL | Hacker News_201411](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8642035)
- If you're storing a tree in an RDBMS, please look into the closure table algorithm rather than adjacency, nested set, or materialized paths.
  - None of the other approaches above have even remotely similar performance characteristics. If your tree is small (tens of nodes), you won't care. If it's bigger, you will.
- Another option for storing tree structures is the closure table. It acts as a sort of "many-to-many" junction table between the tree nodes, storing the relationships between each.

- I've done nested set before; it's interesting - very fast for queries, but requires a lengthy insert/update cost. Also, team members were absolutely clueless as to what was really going on. I'm not sure nested sets are really much faster than what modern rdbms's can provide today.
  - In addition to expensive insert/update, it is necessary to keep the left and right boundaries across ALL of your entries in perfect order. If the boundaries get out of whack, fixing the tree is a nightmare scenario. 
  - I worked on a multi-tenant application with distinct trees present in one table and with one tree per table and so on. Fun fun fun!
- I think the nested intervals model, a refinement of nested sets, solves this slow update problem
- One just needs to be aware that nested sets eventually hit a limit.
  - I experimented with a variation by Vadim Tropashko using something called "Farey fractions" . These represent the intervals as a 2x2 matrix of four integers rather than two floating point values. The numbers are effectively limited to 32-bit values in the matrix since a multiplication is required (resulting in 64-bit intermediate results).

- The project I'm on used materialized paths, which lead to great pain. I investigated nested intervals ... and they could't achieve the tree depths we needed (we were modeling a file system tree).
  - We are back to adjacency lists (using a parent ID) but redesigned to avoid the need for recursive ancestor and descendant queries.
- Can you elaborate on how materialized path caused pain? Was it more performance or maintenance? I would have expected MP to be a good fit for modeling a file system.
  - First, renames and moves require updating all descendants.
  - Second, the materialized path's length exceeded the database's indexable length limit. (MySQL, the DB in question, has a default index limit of 767 bytes, so only first 767 bytes are indexed.)
  - There are ways around these issues (like using "UPDATE ... WHERE" rather than using an ORM to walk the tree and update... sigh). We also had other app-specific / design-specific issues too that swamped these issues performance wise.

- We have used these for our discussion features on Pathwright. With ltree, you don't have as much flexibility when sorting by multiple values. With the Recursive CTE, you can go nuts and still end up very efficient.

- Neo4j is a great database, and I use it myself for a project that involves lots of deep hierarchies. But it has a fairly(Áõ∏ÂΩì) sparse(Á®ÄÂ∞ëÁöÑÔºõÂåÆ‰πèÁöÑ) feature-set where schema enforcement and data integrity checking are concerned; you basically have to add all that stuff yourself at the application level which can amount to a lot of work.
  - To second this, if you're using multiple languages to write to your database, you almost certainly want that schema enforcement at the DB level. We decided not to go with Neo as our canonical database for exactly that reason. Its main strength is probably as a follower or slave to a RDBMS or log file, which is how it seems to be used in enterprise - when you want to do graph-based analytics, you bulk-load a snapshot of your non-graph-stored DB into Neo, then run read-only workloads.

- ## üí°üå≤ I am endlessly fascinated with content tagging systems. 
- https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1534301374166474752
  - They're ubiquitous in software and have so many nuances, but I can't find anything on how to design and implement anymore more than the barebones basics of a system.
  - A tag is a metadata label associated with content, primarily used for querying and grouping. The tag name is also the id: two tags with the same name are the same tag.
  - Tags appear everywhere: #hashtags, wikipedia categories, blog post labels, AWS infra tags...
- we need some kind of relationship between tags
  - The simplest relationship is tag aliases: if A is aliased to B, then querying A is identical to querying B. The only system I know that does that is the fanfiction site AO3
- A harder problem: tag hierarchies, or "subtags".
- There's also implementation considerations. 
  - First, transitive queries are expensive, how do you optimize them? 
  - Second, how do you prevent cycles in the tag hierarchy, where A and B are both transitive subtags of each other?
  - It gets even more complex if tags can have multiple parents, like Wikipedia categories. 

- Postgres "LTREE" data type and associated query operators are an absolute godsend for this
  - You can write a recursive CTE query that traverses an LTREE node hierarchy, and use a combination of custom alias rules, PG trigram/Levenshtein distance to build a simple but robust system

- You should look at WordPress' data structures. Ignore the taxonomy(ÂàÜÁ±ªÊ≥ï) stuff (which is tags in the traditional sense), but the `Post: PostMeta` relationship is implemented as AV and there's a system for querying it. It's the basis of some power features + plugins.

- wikidata might be the solution to your problem.

- One way I think about it is, if you have key-value pair style tags, you basically are implementing entity-attribute-value. That kind of data can be in a triple store, and advanced queries could be semantic web queries, datalog, etc.

- I suspect semantic hashing/search is probably the best way to solve the problems tagging tries to solve - doesn't require maintenance of tag ontology, lets you find documents that don't use the exact word but are v similar
  - search is basically tagging but better
  - [Tagging is Broken - Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.com/blog/tagging-is-broken/)

- I implemented a system once that made use of tagging. We ended up with "tags mean whatever the groups/teams using them want them to mean". Remarkable subcultures arose. All were valid, all were useful.

- ## This document from ScyllaDB makes a strong case why B-trees make a good choice for in-memory collections as well
- https://twitter.com/debasishg/status/1688551567044251648
  - B-trees are usually used for disk based storage. 
  - [The Taming(È©ØÊúç) of the B-Trees - ScyllaDB_202111](https://www.scylladb.com/2021/11/23/the-taming-of-the-b-trees/)
- Also TIL: Google has implemented a C++ template library that implements B-tree containers with an analogous interface to the standard STL map, set, multimap, and multiset containers
- I tested several B-tree implementations on the JVM in https://github.com/szeiger/forest/tree/master/main/src/main/scala/forest/mutable. 
  - I don't remember the exact benchmark results but there was no conclusive case to use them instead of the red-black trees in Scala's TreeMaps.

- Obvious in retrospect, but I just realized that if you use prolly trees for your DB indices, you can run queries against any historical state of your DB (by simply not GC'ing old data). And in fact, @DoltHub supports that
