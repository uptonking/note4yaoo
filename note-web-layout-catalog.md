## CSS Normal Flow Layout

- [Normal Flow Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout)

- Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. 
  - The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. 
  - Once something is taken out of flow it works independently.
- In normal flow, inline elements display in the inline direction, that is in the direction words are displayed in a sentence according to the Writing Mode of the document. 
- Block elements display one after the other, as paragraphs do in the Writing Mode of that document. 
- In English therefore, inline elements display one after the other, starting on the left, and block elements start at the top and move down the page.
