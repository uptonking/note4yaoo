- ## [An interactive intro to CRDTs | Hacker News_202310](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37764581)
- In practice, most apps will only need Last-Writer-Wins registers and not the more complicated sequence CRDT's that you find in Y.js and Automerge.
  - We've built a auto-syncing database that uses CRDTs under the hood but never exposes them through the API. So if you want all of the benefits of CRDTs e.g. offline-first user experience, checkout our project, Triplit!
- why didn't/don't you build Triplit on cr-sqlite?
  - We're aware of cr-sqlite and I've talked to the author, Matt, a few times. 
  - Short answer: SQLite has serious shortcomings when it comes to reactivity and we think we can be as fast as SQLite for the application-type queries we aim to support. 
  - The long answer would be about supporting all of features we don't need in SQLite and all of the quirks that come with it like having `null` as a primary key
  - We also recently came up with a relational-style querying system without joins
