- ## We‚Äôve been spending a lot of time thinking about the best way to expose and implement relational querying in Triplit.
- https://twitter.com/triplit_dev/status/1707509447789043760
  - We‚Äôve decided not to introduce any new concepts like ‚Äújoins‚Äù, ‚Äúlinks‚Äù, or ‚Äúreferences‚Äù. What we settled on is devilishly simple yet powerful
  - Soon in any query, you'll be able to drop a *subquery* right in where clause next to your other filters
  - You can also arbitrarily nest subqueries to simulate traversing a graph of relations!
- I think this [nesting] is the right way. You can more easily de-compose sub-selects into their own reactive queries than if you were to introduce joins.
  - That's been a big motivation. We feel like this is the best format for both the query compiler and for users/devs

- We're working on predefining relations as subqueries in our schemas then you can just use dot notation to access them in filters

  - This cool. In my experience, I‚Äôve found it frustrating when APIs return denormalized formats. You end up having to renormalize things yourself and merge with all the data you already have in some kind of client side database. That‚Äôs something I never understood about graphql
- Totally agree. We're actually going to limit sub-queries to filtering/where clauses to start and only add them into selects when we have a compelling use case

- ## TriplitDB support for javascript Dates, nullable attributes and default values _202309
- https://twitter.com/triplit_dev/status/1704300302373957767
  - Triplit Client support for fetch policies
  - Triplit now supports using Javascript Dates directly in updates and inserts!

- ## one cool thing we did with Tuple DB is we made a wrapper to allow querying across multiple storage backends and dynamically scoping reads and writes to subsets of those storage layers_202308

  - it can let you do cool things like database "forking"
- Interesting. You kind of lose transactional guarantees that way though. What‚Äôs your use case?
  - Yeah we tend to only write to single store at once so it's not much of a concern. But we use it to essentially create two layers where one layer is the cache of committed entities and the other layer (called "outbox") is local mutations that need to be synced. That way a rollback can just be clearing outbox storage but from a querying perspective it seems like one unified layer 

- ## Last week we open sourced our database, TriplitDB._202308
- https://twitter.com/triplit_dev/status/1689051390880989185
- Always glad to see a new triplestore on the block!

- ## Big improvements to our update API - much easier to use and less code! Under the hood we use a ES6 proxy, similar to how Immer.js works. _202308

- ## [An interactive intro to CRDTs | Hacker News_202310](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37764581)
- In practice, most apps will only need Last-Writer-Wins registers and not the more complicated sequence CRDT's that you find in Y.js and Automerge.
  - We've built a auto-syncing database that uses CRDTs under the hood but never exposes them through the API. So if you want all of the benefits of CRDTs e.g. offline-first user experience, checkout our project, Triplit!
- ü§î why didn't/don't you build Triplit on cr-sqlite?
  - We're aware of cr-sqlite and I've talked to the author, Matt, a few times. 
  - Short answer: SQLite has serious shortcomings when it comes to reactivity and we think we can be as fast as SQLite for the application-type queries we aim to support. 
  - The long answer would be about supporting all of features we don't need in SQLite and all of the quirks that come with it like having `null` as a primary key
  - We also recently came up with a relational-style querying system without joins

- ## [Some notes on local-first development | Hacker News_202309](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37488034)
- One common misconception with local-first, is that it's essentially local-only. 
  - But I believe the best experience is where the server and client are equally capable and only a partial set of data is stored on the client. The server still maintains authority but the client is always snappy(ËøÖÈÄüÁöÑ) when updated data or changing queries/views. 
  - We basically call this a full-stack database and we're building that at Triplit.
