  - Databases should make it easy to delete stale data, whether to save on storage costs or for compliance reasons.
  - Read about how you can use TTL (time-to-live) clauses in ClickHouse to delete, reset, or compress old data that’s no longer necessary.

- ## Today(20240308) @ClickHouseDB announced they're moving into the embedded OLAP engine space, with their acquisition of @chdb_io , and directly competing with @duckdb .
- https://twitter.com/medriscoll/status/1765785275014557831
  - Because @chdb_io , like @duckdb , provides a cheaper, faster, and SQL-ier alternative to Spark for crunching data on the data lake.
- If I understood correctly @chdb_io only had a Python API so far? If so, I don’t think that it’s currently on-par with @duckdb
  - Yes agree @duckdb has far more APIs for running in-process, though I suspect Python represents the majority of use cases

- Photon runs inside of Spark as an accelerator for parts of the pipeline, not as a standalone engine, per se.

- @sunchao 's Rust-based Comet project looks awesome and is an open-source alternative to Photon (only available in Databricks Cloud)

- ## Interesting language feature in ClickHouse: LIMIT .. BY column (in addition to ordinary LIMIT). 
- https://twitter.com/lukaseder/status/1768220718469206478
  - It corresponds to PostgreSQL's DISTINCT ON clause, but:
  - 1) is (way) more intuitive, IMO
  - 2) supports more than TOP-1 per group rows
  - Of course, both syntaxes aren't strictly necessary. They're just convenice for ROW_NUMBER() filtering from a derived table, or using QUALIFY, if available
