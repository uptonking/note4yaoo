## v

## v24

- [v23.1.0 (Current) _2024-10-24](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v23.1.0)
  - When a Buffer is created using a resizable `ArrayBuffer`, the Buffer length will now correctly change as the underlying ArrayBuffer size is changed.
  - MockTimers, introduced in April 2023, has just reached stable status. 
  - JSON modules and import attributes are now stable
  - assert: make `assertion_error` use Myers diff algorithm 

### [v23.0.0_20241016](https://openjsf.org/blog/announcing-node.js-23-key-features-and-enhancement)

- [v23.0.0 (Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v23.0.0)

- ‚ú® Support for loading native ES modules using `require()`.
- üóëÔ∏è Dropped Support for Windows 32-bit Systems
- ‚ú® Stabilized `--run` Command: The --run flag has been stabilized for more efficient script execution.

## v22.0.0_20240424

- 
- 
- 

- üîñ [v22.11.0 (LTS) _2024-10-29](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.11.0)
  - Official binaries for Node.js 22.x currently include OpenSSL 3.0.x (more specifically, the quictls OpenSSL fork). 
  - Other than updating metadata, such as the process.release object, to reflect that the release is LTS, no further changes from Node.js 22.10.0 are included.

- [v22.10.0 (Current) _2024-10-16](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.10.0)
  - introduces a "module-sync" exports condition that's enabled when require(esm) is enabled, so packages can supply a synchronous ES module to the Node.js module loader, no matter if it's being required or imported
  - `node --run` is now stable
  - module: support loading entrypoint as url

- [v22.8.0 (Current)_2024-09-03](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.8.0)
  - adds a new API `module.enableCompileCache()` that can be used to enable on-disk code caching of all modules loaded after this API is called. 
    - This is a built-in alternative to the v8-compile-cache/v8-compile-cache-lib packages, but have better performance and supports ESM.
  - New option for `vm.createContext()` to create a context with a freezable globalThis
  - Support for coverage thresholds

- [v22.7.0_20240821](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.7.0)
  - [v22.7.0 (Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.7.0)
  - With the new flag `--experimental-transform-types` it is possible to enable the transformation of TypeScript-only syntax into JavaScript code.
    - This feature allows Node.js to support TypeScript syntax such as Enum and namespace
  - Module syntax detection (the `--experimental-detect-module` flag) is now enabled by default. 

- [v22.6.0_20240806](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.6.0)
  - ‚ú® introduces the `--experimental-strip-types` flag for initial TypeScript support
    - This feature strips type annotations from .ts files, allowing them to run without transforming TypeScript-specific syntax.
    - Supports only inline type annotations, not features like enums or namespaces.
    - Requires explicit file extensions in import and require statements.
    - Enforces the use of the `type` keyword for type imports to avoid runtime errors.
    - Disabled for TypeScript in node_modules by default.
  - introduces the initial support for network inspection in Node.js, using the `--experimental-network-inspection` flag
    - Network inspection is limited to the http and https modules only.

- ### v22.0.0_20240424
  - [Node.js ‚Äî Node v22.0.0 (Current)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.0.0)

- Highlights include require()ing ESM graphs, WebSocket client, updates of the V8 JavaScript engine, and more
- ‚ú® module: support require()ing synchronous ESM graphs 
- üóëÔ∏è esm: drop support for import assertions
- cli: implement `node --run` .
- improve perf of `AbortSignal` creation
- watch: mark as stable
- enable WebSocket by default
- stream: bump default highWaterMark
- update V8 to 12.4.254.14
- v8: enable maglev on supported architectures
- fs: expose glob and globSync
- fs: runtime deprecate `fs.Stats` constructor
- stream: support typed arrays

- ### v21.0.0_20231017
  - [Node.js 21 is now available! | Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v21-release-announce)

- ESM: `--experimental-default-type` flag to flip module defaults
  - Input that is already explicitly defined as ES modules or CommonJS, such as by a package.json "type" field or `.mjs/.cjs` file extension or the --input-type flag, is unaffected. 
  - extensionless files are interpreted as WebAssembly if `--experimental-wasm-modules` is passed
- Module customization hook `globalPreload` removed; use `register` and `initialize` instead
  - use `register` to send data from the application thread to the customization hooks, and the `initialize` hook to establish a communications channel between the threads.
- Stable `fetch/WebStreams`.
  - Both modules were marked as stable
  - This impacts WebStreams, FormData, Headers, Request, Response, and fetch.
- A experimental browser-compatible WebSocket implementation arises with this release
  - `--experimental-websocket`.
- Add `flush` option to `fs.writeFile` function
  - When writing to files, it is possible that data is not immediately flushed to permanent storage. This allows subsequent read operations to see stale data.
  - forces the data to be flushed at the end of a successful write operation.
- introduced the global `navigator` object, enhancing web interoperability. 
  - Now, developers can access hardware concurrency information through `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`
- Support for globs in the Node.js test runner
- updates of the V8 JavaScript engine to 11.8, which is part of Chromium 118

## v20.0.0_20230418_ÁâπÊÄß‰∏çÂ§öÂèØËÄÉËôëv22

- [v20.17.0_20240821](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v20.17.0)
  - adds require() support for synchronous ESM graphs under the flag `--experimental-require-module`.

- [v20.12.0_2024-03-26](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.12.0)
  - implement `crypto.hash()`, 1.2-2x faster than the object-based `createHash()` for smaller inputs (<= 5MB) 
  - vm: support using the default loader to handle dynamic import()
  - stream: add support for deflate-raw format to webstreams compression

- [v20.11.0_2024-01-09](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.11.0)
  - esm: add `import.meta.dirname` and `import.meta.filename`.
    - https://twitter.com/meijer_s/status/1745727753964462431
    - IMO `import.meta.url` is sufficient, but might as well use `filename` and `dirname` if they exist.
    - `import.meta.url` is sufficient, `import.meta.filename` is convenient. Not all abstractions are bad
    - No more `path.dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`;
  - fs: add c++ fast path for writeFileSync utf8
  - stream: use Array for Readable buffer
