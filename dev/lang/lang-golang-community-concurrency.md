- ## Go: we have better concurrency primitives
- https://x.com/_neonsunset/status/1891932056994586756
  - Also Go: has to reimplement . NET's Task system with strictly worse UX 
  - It has nailed a few important defaults: snappy tooling, good autoformat and style choices, structs and non-copying slicing by default, latency-focused GC (with bad failure mode but still) and the vast majority of developers upgrading to it from Python and JavaScript.
