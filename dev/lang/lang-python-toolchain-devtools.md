```sh

uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# also add the requirements to the project's pyproject.toml
uv add -r requirements.txt

# install into the system Python environment.
uv pip install --system
```


- ## ðŸ†š [What's the difference between `uv pip install` and `uv add` Â· Issue #9219 Â· astral-sh/uv _202411](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/9219)
- The `uv pip` APIs are meant to resemble the pip CLI. 
  - uv add, uv run, uv sync, and uv lock are what we call the "project APIs". These are "higher-level"
- `pip install` will only install into its own environment, `uv pip install` can target other environments.
  - `uv run script.py` will activate a virtual environment if necessary, and read PEP 723 inline metadata or sync your project if necessary, then call `python script.py` â€” the latter just uses your current environment as-is.

- ## [The creators of ruff and uv are building a new static type checker for Python : r/Python _202501](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1idk4ko/the_creators_of_ruff_and_uv_are_building_a_new/)
- Free me from pylance please
  - pyright or based-pyright

- Hopefully, this will lead to a language server. A good one.

- Am I the only one who thinks it should be part of Python itself, not a 3rd party lib?
  - I prefer that Astral's type checker be maintained OUTside the processes for Python core. Rough summary: the costs of coordination of the two pieces look to me larger than the benefit of a more inclusive core.

- Like mypy but fast? Sign me up!
  - Mypy will never be in-sync with your IDE so itâ€™s a pain.

- poetry can't do python version management.
- uv can't replace poetry. What do you feel is missing?
  - Dependabot

- ## [My take on UV and Ruff _202501](https://www.jujens.eu/posts/en/2025/Jan/25/uv-and-ruff/)
  - these tools are under very active development and thus change quickly. The drawbacks listed here may not be a think any more when youâ€™ll read it.
- Ruff
  - ruff the linting tool to unite them all, especially formatter.
  - Itâ€™s main selling point is: itâ€™s blazing fast.
  - it will also replace type checkers one day with a much faster alternative.
  - The only issue I see is: ruff doesnâ€™t yet support plugins. 
- uv
  - uv is a new package manager. It can replace pip and tools like poetry
  - It supports dependencies groups and lock files. Everything will be into your pyproject.toml file following the latest PEP. 
  - It can also replace pipx to install and run Python commands. 
  - Even better, you can add dependencies to your script and let uv create a venv and run the script in it with all its dependencies automatically
  - Once again, with uv you donâ€™t need anything else to run Python scripts and projects!
