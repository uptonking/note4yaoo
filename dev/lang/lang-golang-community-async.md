- ## With Go you can create and make sequential programs that communicate with each other through channels.

  - However, the default behavior of a channel is blocking when there is no data to read
  - This is useful for some scenarios where you need a signal before executing something (graceful shutdown). But sometimes you want a piece of program to listen to multiple channels at the same time.
