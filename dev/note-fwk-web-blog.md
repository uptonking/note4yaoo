## üìù [Let‚Äôs learn how modern JavaScript frameworks work by building one | Read the Tea Leaves_202312](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/12/02/lets-learn-how-modern-javascript-frameworks-work-by-building-one/)

- #Ô∏è‚É£ [perf: replace Svelte with vanilla JS ¬∑ nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element](https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element/pull/381)

- From my perspective, the post-React frameworks have all converged on the same foundational ideas:
  - Using reactivity (e.g. signals) for DOM updates.
  - Using cloned templates for DOM rendering.
  - Using modern web APIs like `<template>` and `Proxy`, which make all of the above easier.

- Reactivity
- It‚Äôs often said that ‚ÄúReact is not reactive‚Äù. 
  - What this means is that React has a more pull-based rather than a push-based model.
  - in the worst case, React assumes that your entire virtual DOM tree needs to be rebuilt from scratch, and the only way to prevent these updates is to implement React.memo (or in the old days, shouldComponentUpdate).
- modern frameworks use a push-based reactive model. In this model, individual parts of the component tree subscribe to state updates and only update the DOM when the relevant state changes. 
  - This prioritizes a ‚Äúperformant by default‚Äù design in exchange for some upfront bookkeeping cost (especially in terms of memory) to keep track of which parts of the state are tied to which parts of the UI.
- Note that this technique is not necessarily incompatible with the virtual DOM approach: tools like Preact Signals and Million show that you can have a hybrid system. 

- Cloning DOM trees
- For a long time, the collective wisdom in JavaScript frameworks was that the fastest way to render the DOM is to create and mount each DOM node individually. In other words, you use APIs like `createElement`,         `setAttribute`, and `textContent` to build the DOM piece-by-piece
- One alternative is to just shove a big ol‚Äô HTML string into `innerHTML` and let the browser parse it for you
  - This na√Øve approach has a big downside: if there is any dynamic content in your HTML (for instance, red instead of blue), then you would need to parse HTML strings over and over again.
  - Plus, you are blowing away the DOM with every update, which would reset state such as the value of `<input>`s.
  - using `innerHTML` also has security implications. 
- At some point, though, folks figured out that parsing the HTML once and then calling `cloneNode(true)` on the whole thing is pretty fast
- Here I‚Äôm using a `<template>` tag, which has the advantage of creating ‚Äúinert‚Äù DOM. In other words, things like `<img> or <video autoplay>` don‚Äôt automatically start downloading anything.
  - Tachometer reports that the cloning technique is about 50% faster in Chrome, 15% faster in Firefox, and 10% faster in Safari. 
  - `<template>` is a new-ish browser API, not available in IE11, and originally designed for web components. Somewhat ironically, this technique is now used in a variety of JavaScript frameworks, regardless of whether they use web components or not.
- There is one major challenge with this technique, which is how to efficiently update dynamic content without blowing away DOM state

- Modern JavaScript APIs
- When we build our toy example, we use const dom = html` <div>Hello ${ name }!</div> `
  - Not all frameworks use this tool, but notable ones include Lit, HyperHTML, and ArrowJS. 
  - Tagged template literals can make it much simpler to build ergonomic HTML templating APIs without needing a compiler.

- Step 1: building reactivity /createEffect
- Step 2: DOM rendering /html
- Step 3: combining reactivity and DOM rendering

- Personally I found this project very educational, which is partly why I did it in the first place. I was also looking to replace the current framework for my emoji picker component with a smaller, more custom-built solution. 
- In the future, I think it would be neat if browser APIs were full-featured enough to make it even easier to build a custom framework. 
  - For example, the DOM Part API proposal would take out a lot of the drudgery of the DOM parsing-and-replacement system we built above, while also opening the door to potential browser performance optimizations. 
  -  I could also imagine (with some wild gesticulation) that an extension to Proxy could make it easier to build a full reactivity system without worrying about details like flushing, batching, or cycle detection.

## üë• [Learn how modern JavaScript frameworks work by building one | Hacker News_202312](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38510209)

- I like the article, but it gets some things subtly wrong.
  - > To grossly oversimplify things: React assumes that your entire virtual DOM tree needs to be rebuilt from scratch, and the only way to prevent these updates is to implement useMemo
  - Not quite, on a state update, it rebuilds the component that was updated and all of its children. Not the entire virtual DOM; old versions of Angular did this, but it was wasteful.
  - useMemo doesn't prevent that, but React.memo can (useMemo has a different role; it lets you choose when to recompute or recreate a normal JavaScript object. But on its own it won't stop rerendering of child components!)
- The reason why React isn't "push-only" isn't because it does that, it's because it sometimes buffers updates instead of always pushing them immediately.
  - In fact, other frameworks like ~~Svelte also aren't "push-only" and hence not strictly reactive

- I recently did this because none of them are exactly what I wanted. I really like the idea of reactive proxies and pushing changes. Things get trickier when you try to address mutable arrays and other scenarios.

## [Why I Finally Chose React over Vue.js](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/why-i-finally-chose-react-over-vue-f090cb0e097a)

- After some years building apps with both libraries, I‚Äôve found that I prefer React. 
- It‚Äôs not because React is more popular
- Vue.js is easier ‚Äî but not enough that it makes a difference
- So, if both libraries are so similar, and each has its pros and cons, why do I prefer React?
- The answer ultimately lies in JSX, React‚Äôs templating system. 
  - Whereas Vue uses XML with embedded Javascript, JSX is truly Javascript, only formatted like XML.
  - React, therefore, is JavaScript all the way down ‚Äî and this has two important benefits.

### Better compatibility with TypeScript

- To understand the value of Typescript compatibility, we need to review the benefits of having a type system in the first place.
- For one, it makes code more readable. 
  - it‚Äôs beneficial to future you as you scale the application.
- Second, a type system helps you design more robust abstractions. 
- A final benefit of TypeScript is its help in quickly catching subtle bugs.
- All these benefits mean faster development and fewer bugs, improvements that see increasing returns as the complexity of the application grows.
- JSX = more types
- Every part of a JSX element can (and should) be typed: components, props, children, and so on.
- for a library to integrate well with Typescript, all of its features must be easily typed. Thanks to JSX, React easily meets this criteria.
- Indeed, it is possible to type many of these elements in Vue as well, but the effort required is often greater
- React‚Äôs larger ecosystem does make a difference
- React libraries and add-ons are more likely to support TypeScript.

### A more functional paradigm

- In math and computer science, a function is an operation that consumes some inputs and returns some output. 
- The best functions are pure and deterministic.
- Pure functions have no side effects; they ignore state and care only about the inputs to the function.
- Deterministic functions always return the same output given the same inputs.
- These functions are easier to test, simpler to think about, and improve code readability.
- Since JSX is JavaScript, we can treat JSX elements as first-class variables. 
- The difference may appear insignificant, but there are two distinct disadvantages to Vue‚Äôs organization. 
  - First, it spreads code for one part of the component across the entire file. 
  - Second, it‚Äôs unclear just from looking at the formatAsMoney method where the method is used or what will happen if it‚Äôs changed or removed.
- Another important difference between React and Vue is how child components pass data up to parents. 
  - In React, the parent component passes a function to the child that the child calls; 
  - this pattern demands an advanced understanding of functional JavaScript, but is far more powerful and flexible than Vue‚Äôs `emit` pattern. 
  - And because React‚Äôs functional pattern is truer to Javascript, it also offers superior TypeScript compatibility.

- I‚Äôll close with some final advice: don‚Äôt make an important tech decision without fully understanding your options.
  - Take the time to become proficient at Vue/React to understand its strong and weak points. 
  - Whatever you pick, your choice shouldn‚Äôt determine the quality of your end product, and it certainly shouldn‚Äôt determine the quality of your code
- Sort out your wants and needs as a team, discuss the pros and cons of your options, and reach an agreement that satisfies as much of your team as possible.

## [lit-html vs hyperHTML vs lighterhtml_201902](https://webreflection.medium.com/lit-html-vs-hyperhtml-vs-lighterhtml-c084abfe1285)

- When `lit-html` released at the end of July 2017 as an experimental, not production ready, library, 
  - I‚Äôve created few days after a huge gist comparing it with what was, at that time, the already production ready `hyperHTML`.
- `lighterhtml` was also recently born as hyperHTML drop-in simplified alternative, making the comparison actually fair
- To start with, hyperHTML has a viperHTML node server side alter ego, with API features parity, asynchronous streamed renders, and components.
  - viperHTML is isomorphic hyperHTML , but deprecated
  - This is also true for most modern alternatives of mine, such as ucontent, but if that's the only deal breaker, have a look at heresy-ssr, which is 1:1 based on lighterhtml, hence likely always 100% in features parity with it, 
- Removing all these features, plus simplifying the API, was the goal of lighterhtml, 
  - which in its 0.9 version is as fast as lit-html, but also always smaller, in size, than hyperHTML

- **lit-html VS lighterhtml**
- It is true that lit-html might be slightly richer in features, if you use its directives, 
  - but what I consider important here, is what we can do with just their core, summarized as such:
    - be as standard based as possible
    - create, and use, arbitrary DOM content
    - be able to quickly change content on the page (aka: DOM diffing)
  - These points are what lit-html core offers as a whole, while lighterhtml includes some extra feature we‚Äôll see, and compare, later on.

- How much standard ?
  - Both lighterhtml and lit-html are based on ‚Äújust standards‚Äù, meaning you can use JS without the need to transpile it, and you declare HTML, or SVG, through template literals.
- As developer, you don‚Äôt need to do anything different than writing HTML as you know, the library will figure out at runtime, 
  - accordingly with the kind of node it‚Äôs dealing with, what should result as input.value, as input.disabled, and as input.addEventListener("click", handler) .
- The only real non standard syntax available in lighterhtml, but already widely accepted by the community, is the self closing tag.

- What does `html` return ?
  - In the case of lit-html, the html function tag returns some instance of some internal class used by the library to understand its own content.
  - In lighterhtml though, you can use right away html or svg to create content

- What about performance ?
  - There are two sides to this metric: 
    - one is the bundled size, where smaller would mean faster time to be interpreted, 
    - and one is the raw rendering performance of the library itself.
  - Currently, lighterhtml wins in the keyed benchmark 
    - while lit-html wins in the non keyed one
    - if you‚Äôd like to know why lighterhtml is heavier, 
      - it‚Äôs mostly because it inherits the same compatibility granted by hyperHTML, 
      - and it patches internally, at runtime, a lot of little gotchas found in various browsers or JavaScript transpilers.
    - lit-html also fixes through little global runtime shims some browser, but it‚Äôs not as backward compatible as lighterhtml is.
- What does keyed VS non-keyed mean?
  - In few words, keyed results are the one you‚Äôd expect the most, while non keyed results mean that any created node could represent any sort of data.
  - If it makes any sense, you can think of non-keyed as the result of any server side rendered page, 
    - where nodes that relate to specific articles, items, database results, or user preferences, are just on the layout with some info exposed through some attribute.
  - With keyed results, html.for(entity) will always return the node associated to entity object, 
    - giving us the ability to eventually retrieve, or update, directly, 
    - any node associated to a single entity without even knowing if such node has been already rendered or not.
    - Instead, only what needs to get updated will actually get updated, as you can see in the console.

- In both hyper and lighterhtml case, updates are performed through the domdiff helper 
  - which uses just a node and any sort of algorithm to quickly compute the amount of changes needed between one DOM state, and another.
- Beside constant faster time in the initial creation, I wouldn‚Äôt say lighterhtml is any significantly faster than lit-html in these Code Pens.

- I think both lighterhtml and lit-html win on the Web, cause both provide a relatively straight forward and simple mechanism to create, and update, any sort of content.

- lit-html pros
- built-in directives to simplified common tasks and easily extends the lib
- smallest core when directives, repeat, style-map, and guard functionalities are not needed
- blazing fast compared to any bigger framework

- lighterhtml pros
  - React like hooks out of the box through its `lighterhtml.hook(useRef)`feature 
    - and any hooks oriented project such as augmentor, dom-augmentor, or TNG-Hooks, 
    - so that hooks can provide a way to extend renders as you need, just like directives would do
  - simple to start, simpler to use when it comes to keyed items, 
    - with no need of a repeater and style maps out of the box
  - widely backward compatible and transpilers resistant
  - blazing fast compared to any bigger framework
  - it always wins in terms of memory consumption

## [Web Component Solutions: A Comparison](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/web-component-solutions-a-comparison-e2fa25c34730)

- LitElement seems like an excellent choice, unless you are concerned about the BSD-3-Clause license
- Stencil seems on par with LitElement, but without the license concerns, and would be a great choice, especially if you‚Äôre already using Stencil for design or enjoy working with TypeScript
- if you are using, or might use, Salesforce in the future, LWC is the obvious choice because of its easy integration with other Salesforce workflows
  - You might also consider LWC if you enjoy being an early adopter of new web component technology trends, don‚Äôt like JSX syntax, or have a preference for keeping your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate files.

## [discussion: I think rewriting UI systems every few years and reimplementing in various JS frameworks that come and go is a serious waste of manpower.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18237757)

- I'd so wish people would embrace web components properly once and for all, with LitElement, Svelte or Stencil. 
- If I had to guess, I would guess that React will still be around in 5 years, but I'm not sure web components will. 
  - Sure, they may still be a part of the standard, 
  - but they might be so obscure(Êó†ÂêçÁöÑÔºõÈ≤ú‰∏∫‰∫∫Áü•ÁöÑ) that there isn't enough of a community around them to be a feasible option. 
- I agree, and this is why I use React (or rather Preact) for both apps and interactive elements on the page. 
  - The big caveat is that in practice it's really easy to end up with a React project that is much more difficult to maintain compared to a monolithic(Áªü‰∏ÄÊï¥‰ΩìÁöÑ) framework (Ember, Angular, Vue, even), 
  - because of all the other crap(Ë¥®ÈáèÂ∑ÆÁöÑ‰∏úË•øÔºõËπ©ËÑöË¥ß) that might be used to take care of all the stuff React doesn't do.
  - For example, I recently took on a React project that used a whole bunch of other packages for state management, routing, etc., 
    - and a number of those packages were no longer supported (or outright compromised). 
    - While it's nice that React is still React, a lot of these other packages are tightly woven into the whole 'fabric' (react-swipeable-redux-router type stuff).
  - For my part, when I start a React project I try to minimize these problems by generally avoiding react-specific packages. 
    - So instead of react-router, I'll just use page.js for routing. 
    - In some cases I might use the reactified version (Redux comes to mind, but I avoid that most of the time for smaller stuff).
  - This still isn't a panacea(‰∏áÁÅµËçØÔºõ‰∏áËÉΩ‰πãËÆ°), 
    - and as a result I've been moving more and more stuff to a more 'vanilla' Railsy backend (Elixir/Phoenix, specifically). 
    - While the ecosystem does seem to be stabilizing a bit, it's still insane, 
    - and thankfully there are or will be ways to still add a bunch of 'dynamic' shit to the front-end without drowning in this insanity
- I think UI framework switches happen for two reasons:
  - They've accumulated so much technical debt with their existing solution that progress has slowed to a crawl, developer morale is really low, etc. 
    - A migration strategy can be found that doesn't have such an upfront cost, and will dramatically improve velocity as features are converted.
  - The design is totally changing, or the product is being rethought, and so it's not an invisible code rewrite, it's essentially building a new product.
- You named Web Components, I've been embracing them for a while, 
  - but if you tried to switch from Google's Polymer to LitElement, it wouldn't go smooth as you could have imagined. 
  - Both Polymer and LitElement are based on Shadow Dom and WC features curated by Google, but are not 100% backward compatible. 
  - That is to say, Web Components have been divided from within the same tech. 
  - No need to mention the rival concepts of "everything HTML" of Polymer 2.0 and fixing it to be "all JS and webpack-ready" in 3.0, and consequential deprecation of Bower.
- Svelte and Stencil compile your code into web components 
  - different approach than polymer that is a suite of quite a few higher-level abstractions that you might not want to pay for (20kb of js).
- ‰∏çÂêåuiÂ∫ìÁöÑÊÄßËÉΩ‰∏çÂ•ΩÊØîËæÉÔºåÂ∫ì‰ºöÊõ¥Êñ∞Ôºåjs-frameworks-benchmark‰πü‰ºöÊõ¥Êñ∞
- React and similar frameworks optimise performance by batching DOM updates in one big read-compute-write cycle. 
  - With web components that don't share centralised DOM manipulation code its hard to see how that would work, and this can be a big performance problem.
# more-web-framework
- lit-html is not a new framework, but simply a template library
  - lit-html has no component model, so by using it to implement WCs, you get a component model.
  - A template library is not in direct competition with Web Component base classes/frameworks(polymer, svelte, stencil, skate), but can be used by them. 
    - It's already integrated with Skate, will be integrated with Polymer soon, and Stencil is looking into using it too.
- some folks will avoid lit-HTML in favor of Stencil's JSX approach, 
  - or in favor of Svelte's Vue-alike HTML components, 
  - or more generally to decide whether to observe changes and respond to them or whether to regenerate the UI as a function of state.
- I think you mis/underestimate the extent to which you have a component model already. 
  - What you already have is the equivalent of React's "functional components", where the component is nothing but its render method.
  - When we (Polymer folks) think of a component model, we think of a lifecycle. 
    - Being notified when you boot up, when you're activated, when you're deactivated, and when the state you care about changes. 
    - React has that, Web Components have that, lit doesn't.

- [What's the deal with SvelteKit?](https://svelte.dev/blog/whats-the-deal-with-sveltekit)
  - Sapper is an app framework (or 'metaframework') built on top of Svelte (which is a component framework). 
    - Its job is to make it easy to build Svelte apps with all the modern best practices like server-side rendering (SSR) and code-splitting, and to provide a project structure that makes development productive
    - It uses filesystem-based routing (as popularised by  Nextjs)
    - your project's file structure mirrors the structure of the app itself.
  - The first of those foundational assumptions is that you need to use a module bundler like  or  to build apps. 
    - SvelteKit uses Rollup to make your apps fast
  - The other foundational assumption is that a server-rendered app needs, well, a server. 
    - Sapper effectively has two modes 
      - `sapper build`, which creates a standalone app that has to run on a Node server, 
      - and `sapper export` which bakes your app out as a collection of static files suitable for hosting on services like GitHub Pages.
    - Static files can go pretty much anywhere, but running a Node server (and monitoring/scaling it etc) is less straightforward. 
    - Nowadays we're witnessing a shift towards serverless platforms, in which you as the app author don't need to think about the server your code is running on, with all the attendant(‰º¥ÈöèÁöÑÔºõÂú®Âú∫ÁöÑ) complexity. 
    - SvelteKit fully embraces the serverless paradigm, and will launch with support for all the major serverless providers, 
      - with an 'adapter' API for targeting any platforms that we don't officially cater to. 
      - In addition, we'll be able to do partial pre-rendering, which means that static pages can be generated at build time but dynamic ones get rendered on-demand.
