- ## [NestJS is bad, change my mind : r/node _202511](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1ov6xrd/nestjs_is_bad_change_my_mind/)
  - A lot of over engineered solutions, like the custom implementation for dependency injection, which I feel only complicates the codebase to the detriment of juniors and AI tools, compared to what the ECMASCRIPT specification natively offers
  - A lot of duplicate/custom solutions: for example NestJS internally uses a template language which looks A LOT like EJS, except that in their infinite wisdom they decided to write it from scratch.
  - A lot of unneeded dependencies: why is nestjs shipping webpack in production?!?!?!?

- that's not true. Nestjs's CLI uses Angular Schematics and so their template engine

- He didn't even mention that NestJS doesn't support ESM.
