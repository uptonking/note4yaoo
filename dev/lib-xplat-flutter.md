# lib-xplat-flutter

# guide

- 保守方案：native + webview

- Skia支持硬件加速，Android应用的绘图引擎是Skia，Chrome的2D页面绘图引擎也是 skia。

## react-native

- 跨平台
- 系统架构有缺陷

## flutter

- 跨平台
- 基于非主流的dart语言

- Flutter本身就是因为谷歌不满于webview的性能和html css js的一系列遗留问题，而去重新实现了渲染和ui书写。
  - 我觉得长期而言前端还是会往Flutter这上面走的。
  - 利用flutter render去重新实现web来接着写js总觉得有点削足适履了。

## jetpack compose

- 支持android原生，后续支持win/linux/macOS
  - 基于kotlin，能直接调用丰富的java库
  - swiftui不开源，且对ios版本要求高

- android: When using images for API 27 or later, the emulator can render the Android UI with Skia, which can render more smoothly and efficiently.

- [Compose for Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/) targets the JVM, and supports high-performance, hardware-accelerated UI rendering on all major desktop platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux/x64) by leveraging the powerful native Skia graphics library.

- [Any possibility of releasing Jetpack Compose for Kotlin multiplatform mobile support (Android and iOS) ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/jox14m/any_possibility_of_releasing_jetpack_compose_for/)
- I've started a project like that for iOS. 
  - https://github.com/cl3m/multiplatform-compose
- I don't think we need another Flutter. 
  - Dart sucks and Flutter is very opinionated. Compose is not, it's strictly UI only
- Actually there is POC port of compose on js and they're looking for developers to make it production ready solution. So why not ios/multiplatform later?

## [skia](https://skia.org/)

- Skia is an open source 2D graphics library which provides common APIs that work across a variety of hardware and software platforms. 
- It serves as the graphics engine for Google Chrome and Chrome OS, Android, Flutter, Mozilla Firefox and Firefox OS, and many other products.

- Skia is used by both Flutter and Fuchsia.
  - the versions of Skia being used by Flutter and Fuchsia must be “source compatible”

- ## [如何评价 Flutter for Web？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/323439136/answers/updated)
- Flutter for Web和Flutter在上层都是Dart环境，两者不同的是，
  - Flutter的Dart代码运行在Dart虚拟机中，界面由Flutter引擎处理，通过Skia绘图引擎经由GPU绘制到屏幕上。
  - 而Flutter for Web的Dart代码编译成Java，界面上部分转换成标准的html标签，部分转换成通过Canvas绘制的自定义标签，最终构成一个dom树。
  - 如果Flutter for Web追求（和Flutter）完美的一致性，势必需要大量使用Canvas去绘制，而Canvas去绘制组件的性能（尤其在移动端）至少不会比html标签好。
  - 如果FFW追求性能极限而使用大量标准的html标签，这就会带来和Weex、RN等一样的一致性问题

- ## Jetpack Compose is going to use Skia for rendering the UI. High hopes for the multiplatform
- https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/g6gjug/jetpack_compose_is_going_to_use_skia_for/
- Compose front end is decoupled from Android. 
  - Drawing to android canvas is an implementation detail just like drawing to Skia canvas is. 
  - While this desktop UI implementation (contributed by JetBrains) uses skia there can be other renderers too.
- Android has been using Skia as its 2D library since Android 1.0. Jetpack Compose therefore uses Skia already
- Flutter also uses Skia underhood. 
  - What the point to have 2 basically identical technology for one company? 
  - Oh... it's Google... so very likely one of the project will be killed sooner or later.
- Flutter's future is tied to how successful Dart and Fuchsia teams end up being.
  - It's the opposite. Dart's future is tied to how successful Flutter is. 

- ## 老板们不同意将应用最低部署版本从 iOS 10 提高到 iOS 11，这意味着如果我们想在公司项目中使用SwiftUI 可能还需要等到6、7年以后。
- https://twitter.com/ainopara/status/1382614339106918405
  - Flutter 在中国这么火，可能也有这层原因吧。

- ## [如何评价 SwiftUI？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/327763737/answers/updated)
  - SwiftUI简单来说是一个未完成的无生态的闭源UI框架。。。

- ## [Kotlin、Java和Flutter在安卓项目中的使用情况?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/377409430/answers/updated)
- 对于Android而言， Java至今还是只支持 Java8 而已
  - 安卓上的java本身是阉割版的java，java11之后的特性，基本上安卓上的java没有继续跟进了
  - 而是转向kotlin，以补充低版本java特性的不足
- flutter的owner是谷歌自己，跟kotlin，java的owner不是谷歌自己就不一样
- 当你学会 Java 之后，学习 Kotlin 语言大概就是一周的上手时间，Kotlin 通过大量的语法糖可以加快你的开发速度
- 自己考虑下未来研发的方向，转行Java的工作机会更多

- ## [flutter凉了吗?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/374113031/answers/updated)
- Flutter2.0出来了，Ubuntu选flutter为应用的默认选择
  - Flutter将成为Canonical创建的未来移动和桌面应用程序的默认选择。

- ## [Jetpack Compose or Flutter... which is the safest bet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/judj8o/jetpack_compose_or_flutter_which_is_the_safest_bet/)
- Flutter pros:
  - Easy to learn
  - Used by Google themselves in Google Pay, Google Assistant, Google Ads, etc.
  - Used by Ebay, Alibaba, Baidu, Square, Tencent
  - Used by popular apps like Insight Timer
  - Will work on Fuchsia OS

- Flutter cons:
  - Devs seem to prefer Kotlin over Dart
  - If Google drops Flutter, your investment in learning Dart will be for nothing
  - iOS animation bugs
  - Not many first party plug-ins, and some of the few that exist have issues

- Jetpack Compose pros:
  - Similar to SwiftUI, so easier to get into for new iOS devs and current Android devs
  - Built by Google and Jetbrains, who have a track record of excellent products
  - devs who prefer native android won't have much of a problem with this

- Compose cons:
  - Younger project, currently in Alpha, so who knows if it'll catch up to Flutter by the time it's mature
  - If Flutter continues to grow, it'll be harder to convince Flutter devs to switch
  - With so many companies (including Google) already invested in Flutter, what reason do they have to even consider Compose?
  - If Fuchsia turns out to be a success and not a toy project, Flutter will be ahead in this new OS. Doesn't mean Android will just disappear though

- ## Kotlin multiplatform： A new ReactNative/Flutter/cross-platform contender is here
- https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1300700261359521794
  - Kotlin multiplatform allows to share logic (business or other) between Android and iOS and access native Apis. 
  - No shared UI yet, but that could come later (Jetpack Compose cross platform?)
  - For Swift cross-platform there's also http://scade.io
- Mobile webview tech is still there, and there's a new Cordova alternative pushed by Ionic team
  - https://capacitorjs.com/
  - Capacitor is an open source native runtime for building Web Native apps. 
  - Create cross-platform iOS, Android, and Progressive Web Apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
  - 既然是基于webview，那对native框架的依赖就会降低

- ## Is Jetpack Compose hot reload possible like Flutter?
- https://twitter.com/MehmetPekerrr/status/1375231185127944204
  - I know Jetpack Compose uses the Skia engine to draw on the screen. But jetpack compose preview is not fast as needed. Is it possible technically?
- Hot reload is technically possible, but is currently constrained primarily by build times, and Gradle is especially slow.  
  - Improving hot reload would require improving build times or using an interpreter to bypass builds altogether - possible but requires more engineering.
  - Hot reload in flutter is powered directly by Dart’s ability to directly inject updated source code into the Dart VM when the app is already running.
  - The JVM has the ability to inject new class/method/field definitions. This is how debuggers work in Java.

- ## Flutter Developers working with Jetpack Compose
- https://twitter.com/Fbillionare/status/1375113097388638212
- The similarities aren't super surprising, as we had ongoing discussions with the Flutter team when designing Jetpack Compose. Thankful for all their help and friendship!
