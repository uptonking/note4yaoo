# lib-fwk-jsx-lite-dev

# guide

- jsx-lite /674Star/MIT/202012/ts
  - https://github.com/BuilderIO/jsx-lite
  - https://jsx-lite.builder.io/
  - Write components once, run everywhere. 
  - compiles jsx to React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, web components, vanillajs
  - With JSX lite, you can import designs from Figma or Sketch and convert it to clean code for the framework of your choice. 

- How does it work
  - JSX Lite uses a static subset of JSX, inspired by Solid. 
  - This means we can parse it to a simple JSON structure that it is easy easy to build stringifers off of for various frameworks and implementations
  - JSX Lite's static JSON format also enables no-code tooling for visual code editing and importing, for instance with Builder.io or Figma

  - compiler-focused virtual DOM.
  - Current Virtual DOM implementations are inadequateâ€”Ranging from overcomplicated to abandoned, most are unusable without sacrificing raw performance and size.
  - Million aims to fix this, providing a library-agnostic Virtual DOM to serve as the core for Javascript libraries that focus on precompilation and static analysis.

  - Hacky is built on Million
