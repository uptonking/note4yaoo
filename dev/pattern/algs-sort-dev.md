- [Bogosort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort)
  - bogosort(also known as permutation sort and stupid sort) is a sorting algorithm based on the generate and test paradigm. 
  - The function successively generates permutations of its input until it finds one that is sorted. 
  - It is not considered useful for sorting, but may be used for educational purposes, to contrast it with more efficient algorithms.
