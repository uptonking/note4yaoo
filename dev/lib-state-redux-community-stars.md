- ## React-Redux Roadmap: version 8.x, React 18, and TypeScript
- https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1740
- most likely React-Redux v8 will:
  - Keep the exact same primary public APIs we have now ( `useSelector` and `connect` )
  - Update the internals to be built around `useMutableSource` as an integration layer to provide better compatibility with Concurrent rendering. (It's also possible that we could look at context-based approaches again if React finalizes a "context selectors" API and makes that available.)
