  - Conflicts are not automatically handled ‚Äì they must be dealt with (or not) by the client using bespoke conflict merging code. 
  - If two clients change the same document, whichever client syncs to the server first wins, and the second one gets an ‚Äúconflict event‚Äù when it tries to sync. A particularly clever client imeplementation could use a `json-crdt` to encode the data, and thereby automatically handle merge conflicts without developer or user intervention ü§î but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone try that yet.
  - remoteStorage occupies an interesting place in my mind. On the one hand, it‚Äôs an 8 year old project that still receives active maintenance, which is a pretty big achievement in and of itself. On the other hand, its simplicity means that it‚Äôs lacking a lot of features that people have come to expect from modern web applications. Overall, given that it‚Äôs still actively being developed, it could very well gain some of those features and become a strong solution for building modern local-first apps in the future.

  - a JavaScript library for storing user data locally in the browser, as well as connecting to remoteStorage servers and syncing data across devices and applications.
  - It is also capable of connecting and syncing data with a person's Dropbox or Google Drive account (optional).
  - The first prototype of rs.js was written in November 2010. The library is well-tested and actively maintained.

  - a simple library that combines the localStorage API with a remote server to persist data across browsers and devices.
  - Simple API (same as localStorage)
  - Open source server and client
  - How is remoteStorage different from localStorage?
    - localStorage is a browser API that allows you to store data in the browser. The data is stored locally on the user's device and is not shared across devices or browsers.

  - A web app for taking notes (or copied snippets of text or pictures) and recalling them by context: any words in them, or the date.
  - Data is backed-up and synced with other devices using the remoteStorage protocol, so you control where your data is stored.

  - http://projects.silexlabs.org/unifile/
  - Unified access to cloud storage services through a simple web API.
  - Unifile use an API similar to the native `fs` module but with Bluebird Promises instead of callbacks.
  - Most of the service in Unifile uses OAuth 2 to connect the user into the service. This means Unifile doesn't have the user credential at any time.

  - full support for CRUD operations on data stored
  - locally in the browser's IndexedDB (with Dexie.js)
  - locally in a JSON or SQLite file in the device FS 
# server
