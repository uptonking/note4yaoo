- That made me laugh. My 2 cents after doing this long enough to recognise it
  - Aim for 3NF but not religiously. Still, if you need a flat table try a view.
  - Any ternary relationship can be modeled as a pair of binary relations (you'll never regret keeping it simpler)
  - You don't need EAV (Magento is a good example of why you shouldn't)
  - On the other hand don't serialize data (looking at you WordPress)
  - XML and JSON data types though are perfectly fine when you need to store an object
  - Every table should have a primary key (preferably an integer)
  - If you really want a string for your primary key make it a candidate key (why, because someone will insist on changing it)
  - E/R diagrams are your friend
  - So are Venn diagrams for visualizing a complex select
