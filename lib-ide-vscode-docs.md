## layout

- vscode user interface is divided into five main areas:
- Editor - The main area to edit your files. 
  - You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
- Primary Side Bar - Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your project.
- Activity Bar - Located on the far left-hand side. 
  - Lets you switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when Git is enabled. 
- A Secondary Side Bar is also available to display views opposite the Primary Side Bar.
- Status Bar - Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
- Panel - An additional space for views below the editor region. 
  - By default, it contains output, debug information, errors and warnings, and an integrated terminal. 
  - The Panel can also be moved to the left or right for more vertical space.
# licensing
- some extensions like Wallaby.js, Google Cloud Code, and the VS Code Remote Development extensions use proprietary licenses.
