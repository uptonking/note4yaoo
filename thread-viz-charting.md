- Charts.css uses CSS utility classes to style HTML elements as charts.

  - The data is structured using semantic HTML tags and styled using CSS classes
- Here is a better one (in my opinion) that relies heavily on CSS variables. 
  - The most important thing is that it's accessible.

  - Every charts in this project relies solely on semantic markup — `<table>` based — and a spread of CSS variables carried by the tags. 
  - No JavaScript required for display
