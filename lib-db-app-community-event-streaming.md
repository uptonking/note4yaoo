- ## âž¿ Any unexpected downsides to offering streaming HTTP API endpoints that serve up eg 100, 000 JSON objects in a go rather than asking users to paginate 100 at a time over 1, 000 requests, assuming efficient implementation of that streaming endpoint? _202106

- ## IBM MQ -> RabbitMQ -> Kafka ->Pulsar, How do message queue architectures evolve? 
- https://twitter.com/bytebytego/status/1726861680880304638
- IBM MQ was launched in 1993. It was originally called MQSeries and was renamed WebSphere MQ in 2002. It was renamed to IBM MQ in 2014. 
  - IBM MQ is a very successful product widely used in the financial sector. 
- RabbitMQ architecture differs from IBM MQ and is more similar to Kafka concepts. 
  - The producer publishes a message to an exchange with a specified exchange type. It can be direct, topic, or fanout. The exchange then routes the message into the queues based on different message attributes and the exchange type. The consumers pick up the message accordingly. 
- LinkedIn open sourced Kafka in 2011. Kafka is optimized for writing. 
  - It offers a high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. 
  - It provides a unified event log to enable event streaming and is widely used in internet companies. 
- Pulsar, developed originally by Yahoo, is an all-in-one messaging and streaming platform. 
  - Compared with Kafka, Pulsar incorporates many useful features from other products. 
  - Pulsar architecture is more cloud-native, providing better support for cluster scaling and partition migration, etc.
  - There are two layers in Pulsar architecture: the serving layer and the persistent layer. Pulsar natively supports tiered storage, where we can leverage cheaper object storage like AWS S3 to persist messages for a longer term.

- ## Understanding the Differences between Lambda and Kappa Data Processing Architectures for Big Data_202303

  - [Modern Data Architecture: An Overview of Lambda and Kappa Architectures_202003](https://www.credera.com/insights/modern-data-architecture-an-overview-of-lambda-and-kappa-architectures)

- Lambda and Kappa are two data processing architectures used to analyze large volumes of data in real time
- Lambda Architecture has three layers  
  - the batch layer, which processes historical data in batches, 
  - the speed layer, which processes real-time data streams in a distributed manner, 
  - and the serving layer, which provides queryable views of the data.
- Kappa Architecture, on the other hand, eliminates the batch layer and processes real-time data using a stream processing system, which stores the data in a database.
- Lambda is ideal for scenarios where historical data analysis is important, while Kappa is perfect for situations where real-time insights are critical.
