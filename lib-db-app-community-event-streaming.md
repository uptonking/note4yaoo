- Lambda and Kappa are two data processing architectures used to analyze large volumes of data in real time
- Lambda Architecture has three layers  
  - the batch layer, which processes historical data in batches, 
  - the speed layer, which processes real-time data streams in a distributed manner, 
  - and the serving layer, which provides queryable views of the data.
- Kappa Architecture, on the other hand, eliminates the batch layer and processes real-time data using a stream processing system, which stores the data in a database.
- Lambda is ideal for scenarios where historical data analysis is important, while Kappa is perfect for situations where real-time insights are critical.
