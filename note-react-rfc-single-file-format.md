- ## [React Single File Components Are Here](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1238810260082745344)
  - Dan Abramov: Not this particular format but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been on our mind a lot recently. The split we are interested in unifying though is more about server/client. (We use Suspense and error boundaries for visual states.) Watch out for Flight and Blocks work in React repo.
  - Blocks are generalization of ‚Äúcolocating the query without waterfalls‚Äù pattern from Relay, but without being tied to GraphQL. Instead of a query you have a function that runs on the server.
  - Hydration boundaries are `<Suspense>` components so nothing new there. Same place we already handle loading states.
  - Why is there no directives in reactjs? ÂºïÂÖ•Êñ∞Áî®Ê≥ïÊàñDSL
  - We don‚Äôt like having a special way of doing things when you already have to learn JS constructs to do the same in other parts of your codebase.

# [React Single File Components Are Here](https://www.swyx.io/react-sfcs-here/)

- The launch of RedwoodJS today marks a first: it is the first time React components are being expressed in a single file format with explicit conventions.
- For styling, we might use anything from Tailwind to Styled-JSX to Styled-Components/Emotion to Linaria/Astroturf to CSS Modules/PostCSS/SASS/etc and it is a confusing exhausting random eclectic mix of stuff that makes many experts happy and many beginners lost. 

- Here's what Redwood Cells look like

``` typescript
// Data Example 2
export const QUERY = gql`
  query {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      createdAt
    }
  }
`;

export const Loading = () => <div>Loading...</div>;

export const Empty = () => <div>No posts yet!</div>;

export const Failure = ({ error }) => <div>Error loading posts: {error.message}</div>;

export const Success = ({ posts }) => {
  return posts.map(post => (
    <article>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <div>{post.body}</div>
    </article>
  ));
};
```

- This is a format that is more native to React's paradigms than the Single File Component formats of Vue, Svelte, and my own React SFC proposal a year ago, and I like it a lot.
- Why Formats over Functions are better
  - The idea is that you don't actually need to evaluate the entire component's code and mock the data in order to access one little thing. I
  - This makes your components more consumable and statically analyzable by different toolchains, for example, by Storybook.

- Component Story Format(CSF)
- Team Storybook was actually first to this idea and a major inspiration for me, with it's Component Story Format. Here's how stories should be written

``` typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@storybook/react/demo';

export default { title: 'Button' };

export const withText = () => <Button>Hello Button</Button>;

export const withEmoji = () => (
  <Button>
    <span role="img" aria-label="so cool">
      üòÄ üòé üëç üíØ
    </span>
  </Button>
);
```

- you can consume these files in a lot more different ways by different toolchains (including by design tools!) and none of them have to use Storybook's code, 
- because all they need to know is the spec of the format and how to parse JavaScript. 
  - (yes, JSX compiles to React.createElement, but that is easily mockable).

- Merging CSF and SFCs

``` typescript
// CSF + SFC Example
export default { 
  title: 'PostList',
  excludeStories: ['QUERY']
};

export const QUERY = gql`
  query {
    posts {
      id
      title
      body
      createdAt
    }
  }
`;

export const Loading = () => <div>Loading...</div>;

export const Empty = () => <div>No posts yet!</div>;

export const Failure = ({ error }) => <div>Error loading posts: {error.message}</div>;

export const Success = ({ posts }) => {
  return posts.map(post => (
    <article>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <div>{post.body}</div>
    </article>
  ));
};

```

- I think Styling is the last major frontier we need to integrate. Utility CSS approaches aside, here's how we can include static scoped styles for our components

``` typescript
// Styled SFC - Static Example
export const STYLE = `
  /* only applies to this component */
  h2 {
    color: red
  }
`
export const Success = ({ posts }) => {
  return posts.map(post => (
    <article>
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <div>{post.body}</div>
    </article>
  ));
};

// Styled SFC - Dynamic Example
export const STYLE = props => `
  h2 {
    color: ${props.color} // dynamic!
  }
`
```

- What if styles or other future Single File Component segments need to interact with component state? We could lift hooks up to the module level

``` typescript
// Hooks SFC Example
const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)

export const STYLE = `
  h2 {
    color: ${toggle ? "red" : "blue"}
  }
`
export const Success = ({ posts }) => {
  return posts.map(post => (
    <article>
      <h2 onClick={() => setToggle(!toggle)}>{post.title}</h2>
      {toggle && <div>{post.body}</div>}
    </article>
  ));
};
```

- Dan Abramov replied with something I missed - the server/client split. 
  - There is ongoing work with React Flight (to do with streaming SSR) and Blocks (to do with blocking rendering without being tied to Relay/GraphQL) that I'm basically completely ignorant about.

- While Redwood uses exports to declare loading and error states, Suspense uses `<Suspense>` and error boundaries. 
  - It's possible to compile from the former to the latter but not the other way, 
  - which is a key point of the "formats over functions" idea - things are more consumable that way.

- It also brings to mind the work that Next.js has done with getStaticProps, getStaticPaths and getServerSideProps - as the first hybrid framework, 
  - it is nice to use static exports to let the framework pick from data requirements, as well as to not tie yourself so tightly to GraphQL. 
  - getStaticPaths in particular is very elegant - moving page creation inside components themselves.

- Conclusion - Ending with Why
  - It's reasonable to question why we want everything-in-one file rather than everything-in-a-folder. 
  - But in a sense, SFCs simply centralize what we already do with loaders.
  - Ultimately, Colocating concerns rather than artificially separating them helps us delete and move them around easier, and that optimizes for change.
