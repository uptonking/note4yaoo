- ## [如何评价知识星球（原小密圈）这个 app？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/51524198)
- 本质上是一个围绕着大V为中心展开的微社区。
  - “你平时分享的东西已经有足够多的人看了吗？如果没有，别人为什么还要付费来看呢？”
  - “你真的能一年365天，每天都提供有价值的信息/资源给付费者吗？”

- 如果把规则调整为“自由分享”，只在自己想分享的时间分享呢？就会发现大部分人都渐渐不再分享信息了，而坚持仍在分享的永远是那么几个固定的人，然而这些人一旦连续几次得不到群友的回应，后面也会慢慢失去分享热情。

- [知识星球能竞争过知乎吗？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/8960935052)
  - 知识星球基本就几个大V的粉丝群有点人气，体量跟知乎完全没法比。它更多知识作为一个知识博主的私域变现的渠道之一

- ## [Thoughts on Medium VS Substack? : r/writing _202309](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/16ba9fl/thoughts_on_medium_vs_substack/)
- Medium casts a wide net, Substack goes deep. On Medium you're a drop in the ocean, on Substack you're the star of the show. Medium values quantity, Substack values quality.

- It is possible to use both, but if you go down that route, publish to Substack first and then republish to Medium and set your Substack page as the canonical URL.

- [Medium vs Substack? : r/writing _202303](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/11yzfom/medium_vs_substack/)
  - Medium is a great site to get your work read. 
  - Substack is really for people that already have a following. Not much chance for an unknown to get discovered.

- ## [Medium vs. Substack — What I’ve Learned from Writing on Both _202304](https://medium.com/new-writers-welcome/medium-vs-substack-the-value-of-trying-for-yourself-77e33641b38f)
- Medium: A social blogging platform with an extensive internal audience.
- Substack: A blog publishing platform with built-in newsletter, podcast, and chat functions.
- similarities
  - You can choose to share content for free or monetize it by making it available to an exclusive, members-only audience
  - Both platforms promote your writing to their internal audience (however, Medium’s algorithm is more effective, especially for new writers)
  - Both have detailed audience analytics
  - You can like and comment on articles

- Distinct Medium features
  - Medium monetization is based on 1) how long paying Medium members read your articles and 2) how many people convert to paying members through your referral link
  - Writers who want to monetize need to have at least 1 published article, have at least 100 followers, and have published at least once in the past 6 months
  - Medium has publications, which are “shared spaces for stories written around a common theme or topic, usually by multiple authors” (think magazines or journals)
  - Medium is more conducive to networking with other writers and publications
  - Medium has a larger internal audience than Substack (60 million vs. 30 million monthly visitors)

- Distinct Substack features
  - Substack monetization is based on monthly or annual paid subscriptions, which can produce a steadier income stream than Medium
  - There is no upfront cost to start writing or to monetize (however, they do take 10% of your subscription earnings)
  - Substack allows you to own your email list, meaning you can see the individual emails and export them as you wish, whereas Medium does not
  - Substack allows you to host podcasts, videos, and discussion chats in addition to written content
  - Substack is more conducive to building a close relationship with your personal audience (you have direct access to their inbox in comparison to writing on Medium)

- since Substack is more conducive to building audience loyalty, I plan on publishing more personal stories and travel insights that would appeal to people interested in the travel niche.
