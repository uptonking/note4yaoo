- https://github.com/typeonce-dev/sync-engine-web /ISC/202503/ts
  - https://typeonce.dev/
  - A Sync Engine for the web: React (TanStack Router), Web Workers, Effect, Loro
  - A local-first, offline-capable web sync engine implementation with CRDT-based synchronization. The project provides a complete solution for data synchronization between multiple devices while maintaining data consistency and offline capabilities.
  - Local-First Architecture: Data is primarily stored and managed locally, with server acting as sync + backup
  - CRDT-Based Sync: Uses loro-crdt for conflict-free data synchronization
  - Secure Authentication: JWT-based auth with master/access token system
  - This is a functional implementation of a web sync engine, optimized for single-user scenarios (not real-time collaboration). 
    - The focus is on providing reliable data synchronization while maintaining offline capabilities.

- https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync /MIT/202506/go
  - Any-Sync is an open-source protocol that enables local first communication and collaboration based on CRDTs.
  - It is focused on bringing high-performance communication and collaboration at scale
  - Any-Sync allows users to sync data via local WiFi networks. 
  - Any-Sync uses end-to-end encryption so that backup nodes store encrypted data that they cannot read. Creators control encryption keys; there is no central registry of users
  - Simultaneous support of p2p and remote communication

  - https://github.com/a-type/verdant
  - https://github.com/a-type/lo-fi
  - https://verdant.dev/
  - An IndexedDB-powered database and data sync solution for lightweight, local-first web apps.
  - server‰æùËµñsqlite„ÄÅjwt„ÄÅws
  - Âü∫‰∫éhybrid-logical-clock
  - Undo and redo changes
  - it includes an optional server which unlocks the power of sync and realtime
  - the goal of lo-fi is to be simple and recognizable.
    - One small, generic syncing server is all you need
    - NO. Infinitely growing storage usage
    - NO. Having to deeply understand CRDTs
    - NO. Peer to peer networking
    - NO. WASM-compiled databases in your browser
  - [Investigate: move off dependency on sync SQLite (and multi-node scaling)](https://github.com/a-type/verdant/issues/263)
    - Using better-sqlite3 for synchronous writes also meant that writes block reads for the whole server, which is convenient from an abstract standpoint but also bad from a scaling and adaptability standpoint.
    - Another thing that would block multi-node scaling is server order (unless I did something like LiteStream and only allowed one writer node, but that kind of feels too rigid when I've already got CRDTs in use...).

- https://github.com/webstudio-is/immerhin /ts
  - Send patches around to keep the system in sync.
  - The core idea is to use immer-patches to keep the UI in sync between client and server, multiple clients, or multiple windows.
  - ‰æùËµñ immer-patches
  - It uses Immer as an interface for state mutations and provides a convenient way to group mutations into a single transaction, and enables undo/redo out of the box.
  - Get undo/redo for free
  - Server agnostic
  - State management libraries agnostic (a container interface)
  - **Resolve conflicts (not implemented yet)**
  - [Patches | Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/patches/)
    - The generated patches are similar (but not the same) to the RFC-6902 JSON patch standard, except that the path property is an array, rather than a string. 

- https://github.com/drifting-in-space/driftdb /MIT/rust/ts
  - https://driftdb.com/
  - A real-time data backend for browser-based applications.
  - core Rust driftdb implementation.

- https://github.com/gardencmp/jazz /MIT/202311/ts
  - https://jazz.tools/
  - open-source toolkit for building apps with secure sync.
  - File upload and real-time media streaming
  - Set fine-grained, role-based permissions in Groups that are synced along with your data
  - Permissions verifiably enforced everywhere, using encryption & signatures under the hood.
  - Change roles dynamically for evolving teams, expiring invite links and more.

- https://github.com/serenity-kit/secsync /ts

  - Is an architecture to relay end-to-end encrypted CRDTs over a central service.
  - eg: End-to-end encrypted document using Yjs incl. Cursor Awareness
  - eg: End-to-end encrypted todo list using Automerge
  - Why use a central relay service?
    - The main reason is to exchange data asynchronously.

- https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io /MIT/202403/ts
  - https://deepstreamio.github.io/
  - open source server inspired by concepts behind financial trading technology. 
  - It allows clients and backend services to sync data, send messages and make rpcs at very high speed and scale.
  - Deepstream and Socket.io actually both use engine.io for browser communication
  - The server itself is configurable and uses permission files to validate incoming messages, but doesn‚Äôt hold any custom logic other than that. 
  - It is not an HTTP server, so won‚Äôt be able to serve images, HTML or CSS files. 
  - [Show HN: Deepstream.io ‚Äì open-source real-time server with pub/sub and data sync | Hacker News_201602](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11071916)
  - What is the algorithm used for JSON synchronization? Operational Transformation, CRDT, diff/patch?
    - Currently if a conflict occurs it‚Äôs reported back to the client that triggered it and its up to it to resolve it. We are currently working on configurable merge strategies on a per record level
    - for most use cases, newest update wins is sufficient if it can be done on a fine granular basis (one property of an object/document). It's what web applications have been doing for forever and being a 'realtime' framework doesn't change this if your use case isn't something like google docs.
  - Is this similar to firebase
    - Yes, but there are a number of core differences
    - Deepstream.io is a free open source server, not a PaaS offering
    - Deepstream offers pub-sub, request-response and web-rtc call management in addition to data-sync
    - Firebase‚Äôs data-sync approach is based on one large chunk of JSON data that allows you to observe and manipulate sub-paths. Deepstream does the same, but breaks the data down into individual units, called records
    - Deepstream uses a functional permissioning model, allowing you to interface with other systems (data-bases / active directory) for user-management, as opposed to firebase‚Äô configuration based permissioning approach

- https://github.com/saarw/flushout /201910/ts
  - üí° a distributed data model based on event sourcing. 
  - Collaborative applications use it for clients that need responsive interaction without network delay, or need to function offline.
  - Clients interact with a local proxy of a remote master model without accessing the network. They can then periodically flush changes from the proxy to the master in the background when the network is available.

- https://github.com/spreadjs/spread /js
  - a local JavaScript datastructure, that is instantly synced across devices/nodes/instances
  - It can be used, when building distributed applications, that need local in-memory data for fast access.
  - Use Plain JavaScript Objects
  - Technically the process is pretty simple. 
    - The Storage object is being monitored using a JS Proxy. 
    - Every change will instantly be emitted to the server, where is gets broadcasted to all connected instances. 
    - On each instance, the incoming operation is applied, keeping the storage object in sync.
  - Wen a new instance joins the group, it automatically requests the current state of the storage object. 
    - Any other instance will then send a copy of the data object to the new instance.

- https://github.com/derhuerst/files-sync-stream
  - Sync files (or any blobs of data) between two peers, in both directions, over any transport. 
  - You decide where and how to store the files. 
  - files-sync-stream accepts a generic file read function and emits data events when receiving data.

- https://github.com/kettle11/tangle /ts/rust/wasm
  - https://tanglesync.com/
  - Tangle is a library that aims to make multiplayer apps and games far easier to build.
  - Tangle 'magically' wraps WebAssembly so you can write programs without worrying about message passing, serialization, or consensus.
  - Under the hood Tangle uses peer to peer WebRTC connections. This may change!

- https://github.com/RamonGal/Distributed-Systems /lamport+redis-redlock
  - This view is to be managed by a django rest backend that serves the views json response, which will be a serialized disposition of data from a postgres database.
  - For a perfectly in sync view for different users, we use an implementation of a `Lamport` timestamp.
  - An algorithm for mutual exclusion using a `redis Redlock` was made and the above mentioned timestamp helps determines the pace with which we can apply changes to the shared state.
  - [Redis Redlock](https://redis.com/redis-best-practices/communication-patterns/redlock/) is canonical implementations of locking

- https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango /202212/ts

- https://github.com/primus/primus /MIT/202311/js
  - Primus, the creator god of the transformers & an abstraction layer for real-time to prevent module lock-in.
  - There are a lot of real-time frameworks available for Node.js and they all have different opinions on how real-time should be done. 
  - Primus provides a common low level interface to communicate in real-time using various real-time frameworks.
  - Built-in reconnect, it just works. 
  - Offline detection, Primus is smart enough to detect when users drop their internet connection (switching WIFI points/cell towers for example) and reconnects when they are back online.
  - Automatically encodes and decodes messages using custom parsers. Can be easily switched for binary encoding for example.
  - A clean, stream-compatible interface for the client and server.
  - Comes with an amazing plugin interface to keep the core library as fast and lean as possible while still allowing the server and the client to be extended
  - Primus doesn't ship with real-time frameworks as dependencies, it assumes that you as user add them yourself as a dependency. This is done to keep the module as lightweight as possible

- https://github.com/dmotz/trystero /MIT/202404/js/WebRTC
  - https://oxism.com/trystero
  - Build instant multiplayer webapps, no server required ‚Äî Magic WebRTC matchmaking over BitTorrent, Nostr, MQTT, IPFS, and Firebase
  - Trystero manages a clandestine courier network that lets your application's users talk directly with one another, encrypted and without a server middleman.
  - Peers can connect via BitTorrent, Nostr, MQTT, Firebase, or IPFS ‚Äì all using the same API.
  - Besides making peer matching automatic, Trystero offers some nice abstractions on top of WebRTC:
    - Rooms / broadcasting
    - Automatic chunking and throttling of large data
    - Session data encryption
  - To establish a direct peer-to-peer connection with WebRTC, a signalling channel is needed to exchange peer information (SDP). 
    - Typically this involves running your own matchmaking server but Trystero abstracts this away for you and offers multiple "serverless" strategies for connecting peers (currently BitTorrent, Nostr, MQTT, Firebase, and IPFS).
    - Beyond peer discovery, your app's data never touches the strategy medium and is sent directly peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted between users.
# sync-json
- https://github.com/zettant/realtime-object-sync
  - server and client libraries for realtime JSON object synchronization.

- https://github.com/jsebrech/minisync /Âü∫‰∫édeltaState
  - A library for P2P synchronization of JSON data objects, enabling a set of peers to synchronize changes to a JSON object without relying on a central server.
  - Clients can merge in any and all directions, they just need to have a shared ancestry by initially creating an object from the result of getChanges of any other client.
  - Minisync encodes the changes to send between parties as a JSON structure.
  - Lock-free algorithm, many clients can edit the same object in parallel
  - Eventually consistent state between all clients
  - limitations: This is experimental code and therefore likely to break between versions, causing data loss across all clients when a new minisync version is deployed!

- https://github.com/frameable/pigeon /MIT/202212/js/inactive
  - https://github.com/frameable/pigeon/wiki/Benchmarks
  - Diff, patch, merge, and synchronize JSON documents with an Automerge-compatible interface
  - While Automerge optimizes for working offline and merging changes periodically, Pigeon is optimized for online real-time collaboration.
  - Change sets use JSON-Patch-esque paths, and so are more easily introspectable using existing tools
  - By default, history will grow only to 1000 items in length, after which oldest entries will be jettisoned(ÊäõÊâî, ÊâîÂºÉ)
  - Changes are computed across entire data structures, rather than tracing via proxies
  - Changes may be made in-place for situations where performance is critical
  - Documents need not have a direct common ancestor for patches from one to apply to another
  - Unix timestamps and client ids are used instead of vector clocks to ensure order and determinism
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33865672
    - We have used Automerge a bunch, but found that there is a threshold where beyond a given document size, performance gets exponentially worse, until even trivial updates take many seconds' worth of CPU. That is often how it works when the document end state is exclusively the sum of all the edits that have ever happened
    - Our answer was to reimplement the Automerge API with different mechanics underneath that allows for a "snapshots + recent changes" paradigm, instead of "the doc is the sum of all changes". That way performance doesn't have to degrade over time as changes accumulate.
