  - a set of tools that can be used to build rich text editors with Lexical without having to reinvent the wheel every time.

- https://github.com/fedemartinm/lexical-minifier
  - Exporting the state of the lexical editor can result in a large and unoptimized JSON structure. 
  - This package offers a solution by minifying and unminifying the code produced by the lexical editor, reducing the time it takes to obtain or send the serialized state in a request and freeing up valuable storage space.
