  - A full implementation of CRDTs using hybrid logical clocks and a demo app that uses it
  - This is a demo app used for my dotJS 2019 talk "CRDTs for Mortals(普通人)"
  - It contains a full implementation of hybrid logical clocks to generate timestamp for causal ordering of messages. 
  - Using these timestamps, CRDTs can be easily used to change local data that also syncs to multiple devices. 
  - This also contains an implementation of a merkle tree(默克尔树) to check consistency of the data to make sure all clients are in sync.
  - It provides a server to store and retrieve messages, so that clients don't have to connect peer-to-peer.
  - Server: 132 lines of JS
  - Client: 639 lines of JS

# yjs-crdt
- https://github.com/yousefed/SyncedStore
  - https://syncedstore.org/docs/
  - SyncedStore CRDT is an easy-to-use library for building live, collaborative applications that sync automatically.
  - SyncedStore builds directly on Yjs and Reactive. 
  - It's also inspired by and builds upon the amazing work by MobX and NX Observe.
  - SyncedStore is built as part of TypeCell.
  - So far, we've focused mostly on how to change to state on a synced store, and how to listen (react to) changes and display them in your application.
    -  When you update data on the store, an incremental change, or update is captured and can be shared between users. These updates can be shared between users of your application with different Sync Providers. 
  - y-indexeddb for offline storage​
    - persists document updates to the browsers indexeddb database. 
    - The document is immediately available and only diffs need to be synced through the network provider.
