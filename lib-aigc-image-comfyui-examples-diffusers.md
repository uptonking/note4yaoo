  - SwarmUI (formerly StableSwarmUI), A Modular Stable Diffusion Web-User-Interface, with an emphasis on making powertools easily accessible, high performance, and extensibility
  - Beginner users will love Swarm's primary Generate tab interface with a variety of powerful features. 
  - Advanced users may favor the Comfy Workflow tab to get the unrestricted raw graph, but will still have reason to come back to the Generate tab for convenience features (image editor, auto-workflow-generation, etc) and powertools (eg Grid Generator).

  - ComfyUI-Copilot is an AIGC intelligent assistant built on ComfyUI that provides comprehensive support for tedious workflow building, ComfyUI-related questions, parameter optimization and iteration processes
  - üéØv2-20250814: v2.0 evolves from a "helper tool" into a "development partner"‚Äînot just assisting with workflow development, but capable of autonomously completing development tasks.
  - We now cover the entire workflow lifecycle, including generation, debugging, rewriting, and parameter tuning, aiming to deliver a significantly enhanced creative experience.
  - Debug:ÔºöAutomatically detects errors in your workflow, precisely identifies issues, and provides repair suggestions.
  - Workflow RewritingÔºöOptimizes the current workflow based on your description, such as adjusting parameters, adding nodes, and improving logic.
  - Enhanced Workflow GenerationÔºöUnderstands your requirements more accurately and generates tailored workflows
  - Upgraded Agent ArchitectureÔºöNow aware of your local ComfyUI environment, Copilot delivers optimized, personalized solutions.
  - [Please add local Ai model support (no internet connection required) _202504](https://github.com/AIDC-AI/ComfyUI-Copilot/issues/57)
    - The adoption of the locally deployed model you mentioned is indeed a good idea, and we have considered related optimizations.
    - However, because there are many external data warehouses behind our project, and the entire project uses the Agent tool calling framework, the use of a smaller LLM model will cause the accuracy of the response to drop significantly, so we have abandoned this iterative solution in the short term.
    - In the future, from the perspective of upgrading the entire framework, we will also consider using a small large language model to drive the entire project, and then make relevant updates.
    - I think that adding integration with litellm should be reasonable, there are many MLLMs and LLMs that are supported in vllm that can be called through it. If someone is going to run comfyui in a solid computing environment, it is quite reasonable to self-host LMs

- https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/comfyui-api /218Star/MIT/202508/ts
  - A simple API server to make ComfyUI easy to scale horizontally. 
  - A simple wrapper that facilitates using ComfyUI as a stateless API, either by receiving images in the response, or by sending completed images to a webhook
  - ComfyUI API sits in front of ComfyUI, and uses the ComfyUI `/prompt` API to execute workflows, so any API-formatted prompt can be executed by the server.
  - The server is built with Fastify. It sits in front of ComfyUI, and provides a RESTful API for interacting with ComfyUI.
  - üè† Stateless API: The server is stateless, and can be scaled horizontally to handle more requests. 
    - server is designed to be stateless, meaning that it does not store any state between requests. 
    - This allows the server to be scaled horizontally behind a load balancer, and to handle more requests by adding more instances of the server. 
    - The server uses a configurable warmup workflow to ensure that ComfyUI is ready to accept requests, and to load any required models. 
  - The server supports the full ComfyUI /prompt API, and can be used to execute any ComfyUI workflow.
  - "Synchronous" Support: The server will return base64-encoded images directly in the response, if no webhook is provided.
    - The default behavior of the API is to return an array of base64-encoded outputs in the response body. 
    - All that is needed to do this is to omit the `.webhook` and `.s3` field in the request body.
  - Webhook Support: The server can send completed images to a webhook, which can be used to store images
  - The server can return images in PNG, JPEG, or WebP format, via a parameter in the API request. Most options supported by `sharp` are supported.
  - Dynamic Workflow Endpoints: Automatically mount new workflow endpoints by adding conforming .js or .ts files to the /workflows directory in your docker image.
  - Bring Your Own Models And Extensions: Use any model or extension you want by adding them to the normal ComfyUI directories `/opt/ComfyUI/`.
  - Single Binary: The server is distributed as a single binary, and can be run with no dependencies.
  - The server can forward ComfyUI websocket events to a configured webhook, which can be used to monitor the progress of a workflow.
  - The server is designed to work well with SaladCloud. It is likely to work well with other platforms as well.

  - https://www.discomfort.ai/
  - Control ComfyUI with Python
  - Discomfort is a ComfyUI extension that lets you control your workflows with the power of Python, enabling loops, conditionals, and stateful execution.
  - you can write simple scripts to automate complex image generation tasks, turning your workflows into reusable, programmable components.
  - üè† Discomfort introduces a layer of programmatic control on top of ComfyUI's existing graph-based execution model.
  - ComfyUI's native execution model follows a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pattern, executing nodes once in topological order. 
    - While powerful for single-pass workflows, this model doesn't natively support things like iterations, backpropagation of data, or conditional execution paths.
    - Discomfort addresses these limitations by introducing an execution layer on top of ComfyUI's DAG model, using pre-execution graph manipulation and a self-managed ComfyUI server for isolated runs, as well as a simple data store that handles context throughout the run.
  - Self-Managed ComfyUI Server: Discomfort starts and manages its own ComfyUI instance in the background. This ensures that it doesn't interfere with your regular ComfyUI sessions.
  - Pre-Execution Graph Manipulation: Before a workflow is executed, Discomfort modifies the graph to inject and extract data through the DiscomfortPort nodes.
  - Intelligent Data Handling: Discomfort can handle different types of data, passing large objects like models by reference to avoid unnecessary memory overhead.

- https://github.com/badboysm890/ClaraVerse /3kStar/MIT/202508/ts
  - https://claraverse.space/
  - Privacy-first, fully local AI workspace with Ollama LLM chat, tool calling, agent builder, Stable Diffusion, and embedded n8n-style automation. 
  - No backend. No API keys. Just your stack, your machine.
  - The Story Behind ClaraVerse: Why can't everything be in a single app?
  - The Solution: One App. Six Tools. Zero Compromises.
  - Built on the shoulders of giants: llama.cpp ‚Ä¢ llama-swap ‚Ä¢ faster-whisper ‚Ä¢ ComfyUI ‚Ä¢ N8N

  - Customizable Stable Diffusion frontend for ComfyUI
  - It uses ComfyUI under the hood for maximum power and extensibility.
  - An installation of vanilla ComfyUI for the backend

- https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge /11.4kStar/AGPL/202506/python
  - a platform on top of Stable Diffusion WebUI (based on Gradio)
  - Forge is currently based on SD-WebUI 1.10.1 at this commit. (Because original SD-WebUI is almost static now, Forge will sync with original WebUI every 90 days, or when important fixes.)
  - [Forge Is Not Using ComfyUI as A Backend _202402](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/discussions/169)
    - The backend is WebUI backend with Forge optimizations. (We call it Forge backend.)
    - Forge is not using Comfy as backend. But adopt lot of techniques and code used in comfy.  some of addon modules are just copied from comfy with some modification.
    - i agree, comfyui is NOT the backend 1:1; but most/a lot of the code used in the backend is comfy's code (with a1111 compat fixes which have been known to comfy users for a while now)

# diffusers
- https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers /30.4kStar/apache2/202508/python
  - https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers
  - Diffusers is a library of state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating videos, images, and audio in PyTorch and FLAX
  - Our library is designed with a focus on usability over performance, simple over easy, and customizability over abstractions.
  - Diffusers offers three core components: 
    - diffusion pipelines that can be run in inference with just a few lines of code
    - Interchangeable noise schedulers for different diffusion speeds and output quality
    - Pretrained models that can be used as building blocks
  - [Diffusers current/future _202504](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/discussions/11403)
    - ideas for longer-term priorities for diffusers
    - Better LoRA support: CivitAI is de-facto standard for LoRA distribution so asking for LoRA to be uploaded to HF hub just so it can be tested is a no-no
    - Support single-file everywhere: majority of users prefer single-file safetensors
    - Focus on consumer GPUs: Almost all new models are large 
    - Create differentiators: Remote VAE is another very positive initiative
  - [The different quality between ComfyUI and Diffusers ? _202408](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/discussions/9265)
  - [Why do Diffusers schedulers produce lower quality outputs compared to ComfyUI? _202406](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/discussions/8682)

- https://github.com/cozy-creator/gen-server /202501/python/go
  - A rebuild of ComfyUI, using Diffusers for inference and Golang for efficiency.
  - This repo is not yet useable or functional, and contains a lot of dead code.
  - This repo is the backend used to power cozy.art using Runpod GPUs currently.
  - The graph editor front-end is here: https://github.com/cozy-creator/graph-editor
  - The graph editor is currently not yet functional

- https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp /4.3kStar/MIT/202508/cpp/NoDeps
  - Inference of Stable Diffusion and Flux in pure C/C++
  - Plain C/C++ implementation based on ggml, working in the same way as llama.cpp
  - Super lightweight and without external dependencies
  - SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL and SD3/SD3.5 support
  - https://github.com/piallai/stable-diffusion.cpp
    - a fork of stable-diffusion.cpp. It adds a GUI interface to the executable generating examples.
  - https://github.com/daniandtheweb/sd.cpp-webui /AGPL/python
    - A simple Gradio-based interface for stable-diffusion.cpp.
  - https://github.com/fszontagh/sd.cpp.gui.wx /MIT/cpp
    - A cross-platform GUI for Stable Diffusion C++, built using wxWidgets.
# InvokeAI
- https://github.com/CodeGandee/invokeai-py-client /MIT/202508/python
  - A Python client library to operate InvokeAI system through its web API
  - This client does not re‚Äëimplement the UI; instead it leverages the exported workflow artifact and selected REST endpoints to let GUI users automate large, repeatable runs in Python.
  - https://github.com/VeyDlin/invokeai-python

- https://github.com/Echsecutor/gen_ai_container /MIT/202508/python/js
  - This is a minimalist container running invoke web UI. 
  - I have just turned the installation manual at https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/manual/ into a Dockerfile.
  - See the Comfy UI Docs for how to use Comfy UI

  - The backend API server for Comfy Registry and Comfy CI/CD.

- https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui /AGPL/202508/python
  - This project allows you to run ComfyUI workflows as a serverless API endpoint on the RunPod platform.
  - Submit workflows via API calls and receive generated images as base64 strings or S3 URLs.
  - The worker exposes standard RunPod serverless endpoints (/run, /runsync, /health). 
    - By default, images are returned as base64 strings. 
    - You can configure the worker to upload images to an S3 bucket instead by setting specific environment variables

- https://github.com/replicate/cog-comfyui /MIT/202507/python
  - https://replicate.com/fofr/any-comfyui-workflow
  - Run ComfyUI with an API
  - You‚Äôll need the API version of your ComfyUI workflow. This is different to the commonly shared JSON version, it does not included visual information about nodes
  - You can use LoRAs directly from CivitAI, HuggingFace, or any other URL in two ways
  - To get the best performance from the model you should run a dedicated instance.
