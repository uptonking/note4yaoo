## [Deterministic Simulation Testing for Our Entire SaaS - WarpStream - Stream More, Manage Less](https://www.warpstream.com/blog/deterministic-simulation-testing-for-our-entire-saas)

- Why use Antithesis instead of a traditional Jepsen test? 
  - The Antithesis technology is more robust, and much more likely to catch bugs than the Jepsen harness
  - Antithesis integrates natively into how our engineers are used to working. The entire test setup is expressed using standard docker-compose files and Docker images, and Antithesis tests are kicked off using Github Actions that push WarpStream images to Antithesisâ€™ docker registry.
  - Antithesis testing is designed to be a continuous process with accompanying professional services that help you grow and adapt the tests as the scope of your product increases
  - it would not have been practical to continuously test our entire SaaS platform with Jepsen in the same way that we do with Antithesis.

- The core Raft protocol is implemented in ScyllaDB and ScyllaDB 5.4 implements strongly consistent schema management and topology updates. 
  - ScyllaDB Summit 2024 also features multiple discussions on what ScyllaDB is doing with Raft and what this means for ScyllaDB users.

- ðŸ’¡ extra handshake required for paxos that is removed in raft
- You mean longer term leaders in raft right? This is what I assumed too but I'd still like to read their details
  - in paxos originally had 4 back/forth
