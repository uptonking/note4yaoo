  - Welcome to OpenHands, a platform for autonomous software engineers, powered by AI and LLMs (previously called "OpenDevin").
  - OpenHands agents collaborate with human developers to write code, fix bugs, and ship features.
  - OpenHands works best with Docker version 26.0.0+ (Docker Desktop 4.31.0+). You must be using Linux, Mac OS, or WSL on Windows.

  - Headless IDE for Coding Agents
  - Hide provides containerized development environments for codebases and exposes APIs for agents to interact with them. When given a code repo, Hide spins up a devcontainer, installs the dependencies and provides APIs for codebase interaction. Developers can craft custom toolkits using Hide APIs or use Hide's pre-built toolkits for popular frameworks like Langchain.
