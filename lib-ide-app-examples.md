  - Headless IDE for Coding Agents
  - Hide provides containerized development environments for codebases and exposes APIs for agents to interact with them. When given a code repo, Hide spins up a devcontainer, installs the dependencies and provides APIs for codebase interaction. Developers can craft custom toolkits using Hide APIs or use Hide's pre-built toolkits for popular frameworks like Langchain.
