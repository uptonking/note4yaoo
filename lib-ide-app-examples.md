  - the open-source Cursor alternative，主打隐私安全
  - Void is a fork of the of vscode
  - Write code with the best AI tools, retain full control over your data, and access powerful AI features
  - https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1835850141527601330
    - 可基于 @ollama 加载运行本地模型，让自己的代码不会被提交到服务器，实现本地隐私安全；也预留了在线模型 API 模式，在不涉及到隐私时选择，可直接使用任意 LLM。
    - Code Editor: VSCode 
    - Local LLM: Ollama 
    - Codebase chat: Greptile 
    - Doc Search: DocSearch 
    - 如果是在本地运行，模型参数量级确实不能选太大，性能和速度很难兼得。不过如果是企业内部服务器，还是有机会兼顾性能和安全。
    - cursor的代码补全/提示太迅速及时了 这个能做到吗 除了ai的修改代码功能 我最喜欢就是cursor这个功能了 已经依赖了
    - 用cursor的时候我就找过其他开源的竞品（例如http://continue.dev），大部分步骤（例如embedding、apply、llm）在本地跑都不得劲。或许是我机器太差了？而这些还是相当重要的，例如apply这个在chat完成后自动填入代码这个直接使用普通的llm完成度都太差了。
