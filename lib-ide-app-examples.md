    - 可基于 @ollama 加载运行本地模型，让自己的代码不会被提交到服务器，实现本地隐私安全；也预留了在线模型 API 模式，在不涉及到隐私时选择，可直接使用任意 LLM。
    - Code Editor: VSCode 
    - Local LLM: Ollama 
    - Codebase chat: Greptile 
    - Doc Search: DocSearch 
    - 如果是在本地运行，模型参数量级确实不能选太大，性能和速度很难兼得。不过如果是企业内部服务器，还是有机会兼顾性能和安全。
    - cursor的代码补全/提示太迅速及时了 这个能做到吗 除了ai的修改代码功能 我最喜欢就是cursor这个功能了 已经依赖了
    - 用cursor的时候我就找过其他开源的竞品（例如http://continue.dev），大部分步骤（例如embedding、apply、llm）在本地跑都不得劲。或许是我机器太差了？而这些还是相当重要的，例如apply这个在chat完成后自动填入代码这个直接使用普通的llm完成度都太差了。

# code-search
- https://github.com/sourcebot-dev/sourcebot /MIT/202411/ts
  - https://sourcebot.dev/
  - a fast code indexing and search tool for your codebases. 
  - It is built on top of the zoekt indexer, originally authored by Han-Wen Nienhuys and now maintained by Sourcegraph.
 - https://github.com/sourcegraph/zoekt /apache2/202411/go
    - This is a fast text search engine, intended for use with source code.
    - This is a Sourcegraph fork of github.com/google/zoekt. It is now the main maintained source of Zoekt.

- https://github.com/google/codesearch /BSD/202406/go
  - Fast, indexed regexp search over large file trees
  - Code Search is a tool for indexing and then performing regular expression searches over large bodies of source code. It is a set of command-line programs written in Go.

- https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot /apache2 > private/202306/go/ts/archived
  - https://sourcegraph.com/
  - Sourcegraph makes it easy to read, write, and fix code—even in big, complex codebases.
  - Sourcegraph transitioned to a private monorepo. This repository is a publicly available copy of the sourcegraph/sourcegraph repository as it was just before the migration.
  - Sourcegraph stores most data in a PostgreSQL database. Git repositories, uploaded user content (e.g., image attachments in issues) are stored on the filesystem.
  - [Sourcegraph architecture overview](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph-public-snapshot/blob/main/doc/dev/background-information/architecture/index.md)
    - At its core, Sourcegraph maintains a persistent cache of all repositories that are connected to it. It is persistent, because this data is critical for Sourcegraph to function, but it is ultimately a cache because the code host is the source of truth and our cache is eventually consistent.
    - By default, Sourcegraph uses zoekt to create a trigram index of the default branch of every repository so that searches are fast. This trigram index is the reason why Sourcegraph search is more powerful and faster than what is usually provided by code hosts.
    - Sourcegraph also has a fast search path for code that isn't indexed yet, or for code that will never be indexed (for example: code that is not on a default branch).searcher implements the non-indexed search.
    - Syntax highlighting for any code view, including search results, is provided by Syntect server.
    - Code navigation surfaces data (for example: doc comments for a symbol) and actions (for example: go to definition, find references) based on our semantic understanding of code (unlike search, which is completely text based). By default, Sourcegraph provides imprecise search-based code navigation.
  - [GitHub code search vs. Sourcegraph - Sourcegraph docs](https://docs-legacy.sourcegraph.com/@v4.4.2/getting-started/github-vs-sourcegraph)
    - Sourcegraph is a code intelligence platform that makes codebases intelligible by semantically indexing and analyzing all of an organization’s code, providing developers and engineering leaders with a complete understanding of their codebase. 
    - In addition to universal code search across every code host, Sourcegraph has features to help developers find code, understand and answer questions about code, and fix code faster.
    - GitHub allows you to search indexed code, but not all code is indexed.Files over 350 KiB and empty files are excluded.With GitHub, only the default branch is searchable 
    - Sourcegraph offers structural search, and GitHub code search does not offer this search method. 
    - GitHub code search does not offer commit diff search or commit message search.
  - 🍴 forks
  - https://github.com/SINTEF/sourcegraph /apache2/202302/go/ts/inactive
    - a fork of SourceGraph with a few modifications
    - It only contains the opensource code. The proprietary code is removed to make sure it's not used during compilation.
    - It has a Oauth2 Proxy Mode allowing to fetch the user information from the HTTP headers.

- https://github.com/livegrep/livegrep /BSD/202412/cpp/go
  - http://livegrep.com/
  - Livegrep is a tool, partially inspired by Google Code Search, for interactive regex search of ~gigabyte-scale source repositories
  - livegrep builds an index file of your source code, and then works entirely out of that index, with no further access to the original git repositories.
    - The index file will vary somewhat in size, but will usually be 3-5x the size of the indexed text.
    - livegrep memory-maps the index file into RAM, so it can work out of index files larger than (available) RAM, but will perform better if the file can be loaded entirely into memory. 
  - Livegrep uses Google's re2 regular expression engine, and inherits its supported syntax.

- https://github.com/oracle/opengrok /CDDL/202412/java
  - http://oracle.github.io/opengrok/

- https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa /MIT/202412/rust
  - https://salsa-rs.netlify.app/
  - A generic framework for on-demand, incrementalized computation. 
  - Inspired by adapton, glimmer, and rustc's query system.
  - [Salsa In More Depth (2019.01) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY&t=1348s)
  - The key idea of salsa is that you define your program as a set of queries. 
    - Every query is used like function K -> V that maps from some key of type K to a value of type V. 
    - Queries come in two basic varieties: inputs/functions

- https://github.com/kythe/kythe /apache2/202412/cpp/google
  - https://kythe.io/

  - Sample cross-reference service
  - The Kythe project was founded to provide and support tools and standards that encourage interoperability among programs that manipulate source code
  - 👉🏻 Kythe grew out of our experience creating a large-scale semantic index of cross-references for the enormous, multi-lingual internal codebase at Google
  - What Kythe Provides
    - Language-agnostic graph storage format. Kythe defines a simple, flexible, and portable graph representation that is easy to emit from an instrumented compiler, and for clients to consume.
    - extensible graph schema for a variety of interesting semantic cross-reference data in various languages, including C++, Java, and (soon) Go
    - Analyzers, tools and examples. a self-contained server that can use Kythe data to answer cross-reference queries;
  - https://github.com/TreeTide/underhood /202203/inactive
    - UnderHood is a code browsing interface backed by Kythe indices.
    - With https://github.com/TreeTide/underhood, my goal is to provide a read-only view of code, geared for understanding and debugging. Having to maintain the ability to edit comes with constraints.

- https://github.com/facebookincubator/glean /BSD/202412/haskell/cpp/facebook
  - https://glean.software/

- https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear /GPL/202411/cpp
  - Bear is a tool that generates a compilation database for clang tooling.
  - The JSON compilation database is used in the clang project to provide information on how a single compilation unit is processed. With this, it is easy to re-run the compilation with alternate programs.
  - Some build system natively supports the generation of JSON compilation database. For projects which does not use such build tool, Bear generates the JSON file during the build process.
