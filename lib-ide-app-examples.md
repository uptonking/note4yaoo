- https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider /17kStar/apache2/202408/python
  - https://aider.chat/
  - aider is AI pair programming in your terminal
  - Aider works best with GPT-4o & Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can connect to almost any LLM.
  - Aider uses a map of your entire git repo, which helps it work well in larger codebases.
  - Aider has one of the top scores on SWE Bench

  - https://docs.all-hands.dev/
  - Welcome to OpenHands, a platform for autonomous software engineers, powered by AI and LLMs (previously called "OpenDevin").
  - OpenHands agents collaborate with human developers to write code, fix bugs, and ship features.
  - OpenHands works best with Docker version 26.0.0+ (Docker Desktop 4.31.0+). You must be using Linux, Mac OS, or WSL on Windows.

- https://github.com/stitionai/devika /18.2kStar/MIT/202408/python/svelte
  - Devika is an advanced AI software engineer that can understand high-level human instructions, break them down into steps, research relevant information, and write code to achieve the given objective.
  - Devika is modeled after Devin, aims to be an open-source alternative to Devin
  - Supports Claude 3, GPT-4, Gemini, Mistral , Groq and Local LLMs via Ollama. For optimal performance: Use the Claude 3 family of models.

- https://github.com/Doriandarko/claude-engineer /202408/python
  - Claude Engineer is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) that leverages the power of Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet model to assist with software development tasks
  - Comprehensive file system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)

- https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer /MIT/202408/python/非开源?
  - https://gptengineer.app/
  - Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.
  - gptengineer.app is a commercial project for the automatic generation of web apps. It features a UI for non-technical users connected to a git-controlled codebase. The gptengineer.app team is actively supporting the open source community.
# coding-ai
- https://github.com/artmoskvin/hide /MIT/202408/go
  - https://hide.sh/
  - Headless IDE for Coding Agents
  - Hide provides containerized development environments for codebases and exposes APIs for agents to interact with them. When given a code repo, Hide spins up a devcontainer, installs the dependencies and provides APIs for codebase interaction. Developers can craft custom toolkits using Hide APIs or use Hide's pre-built toolkits for popular frameworks like Langchain.

  - https://docs.argilla.io/
  - Argilla is a collaboration tool for AI engineers and domain experts who need to build high-quality datasets for their projects.
  - Argilla can be used for collecting human feedback for a wide variety of AI projects like traditional NLP (text classification, NER, etc.), LLMs (RAG, preference tuning, etc.), or multimodal models (text to image, etc.). Argilla's programmatic approach lets you build workflows for continuous evaluation and model improvement. 
  - Take control of your data and models



- https://github.com/TabbyML/tabby /apache2/202408/rust
  - https://tabbyml.github.io/tabby
  - Self-hosted AI coding assistant. 
  - An opensource / on-prem alternative to GitHub Copilot.
  - Self-contained, with no need for a DBMS or cloud service
  - OpenAPI interface, easy to integrate with existing infrastructure (e.g Cloud IDE).
  - Tabby 是一个自我托管的 #GitHub #Copliot 开源替代品，自带可视化界面与 #OpenAPI 接口，还支持消费者级别的 #GPU，具有 FP-16 重量加载和各种优化功能，提供了 #Docker 镜像


- https://github.com/SilasMarvin/lsp-ai /MIT/202408/rust
  - LSP-AI is an open-source language server that serves as a backend for AI-powered functionality, designed to assist and empower software engineers, not replace them.
  - It offers features like in-editor chatting with LLMs and code completions. Because it is a language server, it works with any editor that has LSP support.
  - In-Editor Chatting
  - Note that speed for completions is entirely dependent on the backend being used. For the fastest completions we recommend using either a small local model or Groq


- https://github.com/morph-labs/rift /apache2/202310/python/inactive
  - https://morph.so/
  - Rift: an AI-native language server for your personal AI software engineer
  - The Rift Code Engine implements an AI-native extension of the language server protocol. The Rift VSCode extension implements a client and end-user interface which is the first step into that future.
