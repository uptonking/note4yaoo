  - Thorium-reader is composed of 3 parts: 
    - One node.js main process (electron back-end) 
    - One library window (chromium renderer) 
    - One to N reader window(s) (chromium renderer)
    - Each part runs a model-controller and a view for the renderer process.
  - A great care is taken to ensure the accessibility of the application for visual impaired people using NVDA, JAWS or Narrator.
  - No ads. No private data flowing anywhere.
  - [Feature proposal: read PDFs as HTML _202502](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/discussions/2810)
    - We never intended to have strong PDF support, considering that other reading software already provides a good reading experience.
    - This seems like a format conversion tool (PDF to EPUB) more than a Thorium feature. Thorium could ultimately integrate this tool transparently like we do with DAISY 2.02 and DAISY 3.0 text / text+audio / audio digital talking books.
  - [consider to swap to mupdfjs ?](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/discussions/2742)
    - PDF.js may be a slower rendering engine, but it is a mature library, with a strong feature set (including text selection + annotations) and a page layout logic that integrates quite well in Thorium.

- https://github.com/dutchigor/pluggable-electron /MIT/202401/js/inactive
  - A framework to build Electron apps that can be extended by other parties.
  - Pluggable Electron allows an Electron app to include extension points in the code. 
    - Plugin developers can then write extensions - in the form of npm packages - that can be inserted into these extension points.
  - The framework includes the tools necessary to manage the whole life cycle of plugins, for example writing, installing, uninstalling and updating plugins, and creating and triggering extension points.
  - The framework uses inversion of control and dependency inversion principles for this.
  - [Allow dependencies between plugins ](https://github.com/dutchigor/pluggable-electron/issues/13)
    - Pluggable Electron makes it possible for plugins to add their own extension points that can be registered to by other plugins. Whilst this is useful, this can become confusing if a plugin requires that other plugin to be present but it is not.
    - But since Pluggable Electron is based on npm packages, the obvious solution here would be to usilise the dependencies these packages.
  - [How about custom UI plugins? _202110](https://github.com/dutchigor/pluggable-electron/issues/2)
    - Version 0.2.0 has now been released and this supports importing Pluggable Electron into ES modules on the front end.

    - The library is a rough copy of i18next-node-fs-backend but using IPC (inter-process-communication) to request a file be read or written from the electron's main process.

- https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate /MIT/202309/ts
  - https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/
  - Electron React Boilerplate uses Electron, React, React Router, Webpack and React Fast Refresh.
  - Hot Reloading: Make changes to your app and preview the changes without having to refresh your app.
  - Optimization and minification of code with webpack comes out of the box.
  - Why is webpack a good idea for electron? Webpack helps us reduce the amount of calls made to require by bundling all our code (when possible) into single file. Atom is slow primarily because it makes so many require statements.

# storage
- https://github.com/oguz-yilmaz/localforage-file-system-adapter /202312/ts/inactive
  - A file system adapter for LocalForage designed specifically for Electron applications, providing simple file-based storage with a familiar LocalForage API.
  - This adapter implements LocalForage's driver interface to store data in the local file system, making it ideal for Electron apps that need persistent storage without SQLite or other database solutions.
  - Simple file-based storage
  - Simple key-value storage only, Basic string-based storage
  - Not suitable for large datasets

# utils
- https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier /MIT/202309/ts/archived
  - a command-line tool to easily create a “desktop app” for any web site with minimal fuss. 
  - Apps are wrapped by Electron
  - [Nativefier is unmaintained _202309](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1577)
    - Nativefier was built a couple of years ago before the ability to create shortcuts for websites in Chrome, or similarly on Firefox. 
    - Users who want to build and use their own website wrappers should strongly prefer these options as they are protected from security vulnerabilities by the browser's self updating mechanism.
    - Otherwise, if the use case is to build a bespoke app wrapping a website for distribution, consider using Electron directly which offers much more flexibility.

- https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-util /MIT/202401/ts
  - Useful utilities for Electron apps and modules
  - There are three parts of this package, “shared”, “main”, and “node”. The “shared” part works in both the main or rendered process. The “main” part works only in the main process. The “node” part is for Node.js-only APIs (not Electron).
  - To use features from the “main” part in the renderer process, you will need to set up IPC channels.

- https://github.com/kunalnagar/encrypt0r /MIT/202211/ts

## utils-messaging

- https://github.com/linonetwo/electron-ipc-cat /MIT/202307/ts
  - Passing object and type between Electron main process and renderer process simply via preload script.
  - In latest electron, the remote module is deprecated, and you are required to passing data using IPC. 
  - Based on frankwallis/electron-ipc-proxy, and used in TiddlyGit-Desktop.
    - electron-ipc-proxy doesn't work well when we have `contextIsolation: true`, so here we have electron-ipc-cat
  - Only plain objects can be passed between the 2 sides of the proxy, as the data is serialized to JSON, so no functions or prototypes will make it across to the other side.
  - https://github.com/frankwallis/electron-ipc-proxy /MIT/202010/ts
    - Transparent asynchronous electron remoting using IPC.

- https://github.com/daltonmenezes/interprocess /MIT/202308/ts
  - https://daltonmenezes.github.io/interprocess/
  - A scalable and type-safe Electron IPC management tool with enhanced DX
  - Electron IPC is good, but difficult to maintain and scale, either because of the numerous channels you have to remember, or because of the inconsistent API between processes and the absence of inferred types of your channels and handlers.
  - invoke and handle methods in both processes with the same expected behavior
