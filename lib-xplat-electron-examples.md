  - Thorium-reader is composed of 3 parts: 
    - One node.js main process (electron back-end) 
    - One library window (chromium renderer) 
    - One to N reader window(s) (chromium renderer)
    - Each part runs a model-controller and a view for the renderer process.
  - A great care is taken to ensure the accessibility of the application for visual impaired people using NVDA, JAWS or Narrator.
  - No ads. No private data flowing anywhere.
  - [Feature proposal: read PDFs as HTML _202502](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/discussions/2810)
    - We never intended to have strong PDF support, considering that other reading software already provides a good reading experience.
    - This seems like a format conversion tool (PDF to EPUB) more than a Thorium feature. Thorium could ultimately integrate this tool transparently like we do with DAISY 2.02 and DAISY 3.0 text / text+audio / audio digital talking books.
  - [consider to swap to mupdfjs ?](https://github.com/edrlab/thorium-reader/discussions/2742)
    - PDF.js may be a slower rendering engine, but it is a mature library, with a strong feature set (including text selection + annotations) and a page layout logic that integrates quite well in Thorium.

- https://github.com/dutchigor/pluggable-electron /MIT/202401/js/inactive
  - A framework to build Electron apps that can be extended by other parties.
  - Pluggable Electron allows an Electron app to include extension points in the code. 
    - Plugin developers can then write extensions - in the form of npm packages - that can be inserted into these extension points.
  - The framework includes the tools necessary to manage the whole life cycle of plugins, for example writing, installing, uninstalling and updating plugins, and creating and triggering extension points.
  - The framework uses inversion of control and dependency inversion principles for this.
  - [Allow dependencies between plugins ](https://github.com/dutchigor/pluggable-electron/issues/13)
    - Pluggable Electron makes it possible for plugins to add their own extension points that can be registered to by other plugins. Whilst this is useful, this can become confusing if a plugin requires that other plugin to be present but it is not.
    - But since Pluggable Electron is based on npm packages, the obvious solution here would be to usilise the dependencies these packages.
  - [How about custom UI plugins? _202110](https://github.com/dutchigor/pluggable-electron/issues/2)
    - Version 0.2.0 has now been released and this supports importing Pluggable Electron into ES modules on the front end.

  - Hot Reloading: Make changes to your app and preview the changes without having to refresh your app.
  - Optimization and minification of code with webpack comes out of the box.
  - Why is webpack a good idea for electron? Webpack helps us reduce the amount of calls made to require by bundling all our code (when possible) into single file. Atom is slow primarily because it makes so many require statements.

  - Apps are wrapped by Electron
  - [Nativefier is unmaintained _202309](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1577)
    - Nativefier was built a couple of years ago before the ability to create shortcuts for websites in Chrome, or similarly on Firefox. 
    - Users who want to build and use their own website wrappers should strongly prefer these options as they are protected from security vulnerabilities by the browser's self updating mechanism.

  - Based on frankwallis/electron-ipc-proxy, and used in TiddlyGit-Desktop.
    - electron-ipc-proxy doesn't work well when we have `contextIsolation: true`, so here we have electron-ipc-cat
  - Only plain objects can be passed between the 2 sides of the proxy, as the data is serialized to JSON, so no functions or prototypes will make it across to the other side.
  - https://github.com/frankwallis/electron-ipc-proxy /MIT/202010/ts

  - It can install, update, reinstall and run Invoke Community Edition. It is self-contained, so you don't need to worry about having the right python version installed.
  - 依赖@electron-toolkit/typed-ipc、electron-builder、node-pty、xterm、@emotion/react、vite
  - Using the launcher to update Invoke
  - Updating the launcher itself
  - The launcher is an electron application with React UI. We bundle `uv` with the build and then call it to install python, create the app `venv`, and run the app.
  - If installation fails, retrying the install in Repair Mode may fix it. 
  - Like the install script, the launcher creates and manages a normal python virtual environment.
  - The "old" scripts will be phased out over time. The goal is to support 3 ways to install and run Invoke:
    - Launcher
    - Docker
    - Manual (e.g. create a `venv` manually, install the `invokeai` package, run it as a script)

- https://github.com/saviornt/Local-AI-Interface /MIT/202507/js/inactive
  - A desktop application built with Electron that provides a user-friendly interface for managing and interacting with local AI services, including Ollama (for Large Language Models) and n8n (for workflow automation). 
  - This project aims to simplify the setup and usage of a personal, local AI stack.
  - Dockerized Services: All backend AI services run in isolated Docker containers, ensuring easy setup and management.
  - One-Command Setup: A single command to get both Docker services running and the desktop application built.
  - Prerequisites
    - Docker Desktop: Includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose. Essential for running the AI services.
# tauri
- https://github.com/zap-studio/local.ts /MIT/202601/rust/ts
  - https://www.zapstudio.dev/local-ts
  - A starter kit for building local-first applications for mobile and desktop.
  - Build for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android
  - Lightweight — Native performance with a small bundle size
  - Secure — Built-in Content Security Policy and Tauri's security model
  - System Tray — Background operation with show/hide and quit actions
  - SQLite with Diesel ORM and automatic migrations
  - Autostart — Launch at login with user-configurable settings

- https://github.com/12joan/ping-ui
  - A simple GUI for the ping command-line utility built using Tauri.
  - Requires ping to be in the PATH and for the output of ping to have the following format
# nwjs
- https://github.com/nwutils/electron-to-nwjs /js
  - This project aims to build an Electron app as a NW.js app.
  - The Electron main file is converted into the NW.js main file using webpack, by replacing the Electron modules with compatibility layers that make them use the NW.js commands instead.

  - a experimental, Electron-compatible runtime on top of Gecko

- https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo /apache2/201906/js/deprecated
  - Carlo provides Node applications with Google Chrome rendering capabilities, communicates with the locally-installed browser instance using the `Puppeteer` project, and implements a remote call infrastructure for communication between Node and the browser.
  - Carlo prints an error message when Chrome can not be located.
  - The application can be bundled into a single executable using `pkg`.
  - 🆚️ What was the motivation when we already have Electron and NW.js?
    - One of the motivations of this project is to demonstrate how browsers that are installed locally can be used with Node out of the box.
    - Node v8 and Chrome v8 engines are decoupled in Carlo
