  - the general consensus of the community is that you should not put your form state in Redux.
  - The author of Redux Form took all of the lessons he learned about form use cases from maintaining Redux Form and built React Final Form
  - The only good reason, in the author's view, to use Redux Form is if you need really tight coupling of your form data with Redux
  - If you don't have that requirement, use React Final Form.
