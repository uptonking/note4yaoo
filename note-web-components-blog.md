  - I couldn‚Äôt really use React in the bundle-free dev workflows
  - The problem is JSX‚Äîyou gotta run it through Babel. There‚Äôs no way around it!
  - a few options:
    - Skip JSX and use React.createElement instead.
    - Replace JSX with a bundle-free alternative like hyperscript or htm.
    - Use a React-alternative written in Vanilla JS. üèó
