- About ag-Grid and Handsontable... I am founder of another JavaScript Grid product. FancyGrid. I know much about this market and situation. 
  - ag-Grid is too popular and trampled all competitors over catching almost all possible commercial clients. It is unreal to compete with them, they killed this market and become monopolist. 
  - Handsontable has no way to do. Now ag-Grid also is going to kill JavaScript Chart Libraries market. 
  - Sorely ag-Grid is too successful and leaves no chance for competitors to survive.
