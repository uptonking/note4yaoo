- Mattermost Boards enable your team to manage projects and tasks via a familiar Kanban board structure.
  - Keep everyone in your team and organization in the loop to stay on schedule with clearly defined tasks, owners, checklists, and deadlines. 
  - Keep everything your team needs in one place, including documents, images, and important hyperlinks.

- A board is a collection of cards to help you manage your projects, organize tasks, and collaborate with your team all in one place.
  - Boards can be displayed and filtered in different views such as kanban, table, calendar, and gallery views to help you organize your work items

- Cards are used on a board to track individual work items.

- Card grouping is only available in **board** and **table** views and you must have at least one `Select` or `Person` property on your board for grouping to work.
