  - A javascript neural network library. 
  - It can train with backpropagation or neural evolution! 
  - [A better alternative to convnetjs](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/issues/122)
    - This library has Deconv layers and other new features that not even convnetjs has.
    - It also doesn't require you to put your data in a custom data type.

  - Deep Learning in Javascript. Alternative to ConvNetJS, that is 4x faster.
  - [A 4x faster alternative to ConvNetJS](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/issues/115)
    - It has capabilities similar to ConvNetJS, but both training and testing are 4x faster (while still running in a single JS thread on the CPU).

  - The Fastest DNN Running Framework on Web Browser

  - Deep Learning in Javascript. Train Convolutional Neural Networks (or ordinary ones) in your browser.
  - [[Question] Why use javascript ?](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/issues/72)
    - Performance-wise there is no reason to believe that JavaScript would perform significantly slower than Python. The reason why Python is used over C++ is not performance, it is the ecosystem.
    - For fast execution Python or C++ might not even be the best for neural networks as GPGPU computing could be the ultimate solution for fast parallel computing of lots of artificial neurons. In that case JavaScript would yield roughly the same performances as Python of C++.
