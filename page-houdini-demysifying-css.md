## [Houdini: Demystifying CSS](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/05/houdini)

- The Houdini task force consists of engineers from Mozilla, Apple, Opera, Microsoft, HP, Intel and Google working together to expose certain parts of the CSS engine to web developers. 
- The task force is working on a collection of drafts with the goal to get them accepted by the W3C to become actual web standards. 
- They set themselves a few high-level goals, turned them into specification drafts which in turn gave birth to a set of supporting, lower-level specification drafts. 
- The collection of these drafts is what is usually meant when someone talks about **Houdini**. 
- At the time of writing, the list of drafts is incomplete and some of the drafts are mere placeholders. Thatâ€™s how early in development of Houdini we are.
