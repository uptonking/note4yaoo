  - I'm fetching MDX content as strings from an API and rendering them inside a React site/app. 
  - I was able to achieve this with @mdx-js /runtime, which exposes exactly the API I'm looking for.
  - but warning: this is not the preferred way to use MDX since it introduces a substantial amount of overhead and dramatically increases bundle sizes. It should also not be used with user input that isnâ€™t sandboxed.
- TL; DR: There isn't a quick and easy way to do either on the client side.
  - Serverside rendering or prerendering through webpack will get better results.
  - This is due to both a full markdown parser (remark), part of a JavaScript parser (babel/buble) being included in the bundle.
  - Both are needed, and neither is currently provided natively by a browser.
  - Easiest approach to minimizing the size would be to use a bundler that supports tree-shaking (like webpack or rollup) to cut back on unused files included.
- MDX can include both JSX/React elements and plain ol' HTML elements.
  - Unsandboxed user entered content can lead to issues like cross site scripting

  - The most lightweight, customizable React markdown component.
  - All this clocks in at around 5 kB gzipped, which is a fraction of the size of most other React markdown components.
  - markdown-to-jsx uses a heavily-modified fork of simple-markdown as its parsing engine
