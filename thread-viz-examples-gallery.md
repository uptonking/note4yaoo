- ## Can we visualize a codebase?
- https://twitter.com/Wattenberger/status/1423259472919674882
  - We always look at our code in a file/folder list - what would a bird's-eye-view look like, and how could that enhance our understanding of code?
  - [Visualizing a codebase](https://octo.github.com/projects/repo-visualization)
- I love this exploration! a better way to browse files than the standard file list. I especially like the by-commit visualization to see what files people are changing (near bottom). a good way to get pulse of codebase
- Nice work! There are a few existing VR tools (e.g. @PrimitiveVR ) but I think it might be too limiting to focus exclusively on code which is literally an implementation detail. I’m exploring design level visualization & tooling but progress is slow
