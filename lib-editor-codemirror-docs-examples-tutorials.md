## ðŸ”€ [CodeMirror Collaborative Example](https://codemirror.net/examples/collab/)

- Real-time collaborative editing is a technique where multiple people on different machines can edit the same document at the same time.
  - The main difficulty with this style of editing is handling of conflicting editsâ€”since network communication isn't instantaneous, it is possible for people to make changes at the same time, which have to be reconciled in some way when synchronizing everybody up again.
- CodeMirror comes with utilities for collaborative editing based on operational transformation with a central authority (server) that assigns a definite order to the changes. 

- It is also possible to wire up different collaborative editing algorithms to CodeMirror. See for example Yjs.

- There is one thing to keep in mind though. As described in more detail in the collaborative-editing blog post, the kind of position mapping done in the effect's `map` function is not guaranteed to converge to the same positions when applied in different order by different peers. 
  - For some use cases (such as showing other people's cursor), this may be harmless. 
  - For others, you might need to set up a separate mechanism to periodically synchronize the positions.
