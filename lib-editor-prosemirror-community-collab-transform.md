- ## A simple implementation of prosemirror-collab__201905
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/a-simple-implementation-of-prosemirror-collab/1930
  - the prosemirror-collab example on the ProseMirror website is very complex
  - On my example a websocket-server on glitch.com is used (nice service which you can run a public socket server for free). There is also support to debounce all changes so everything is asynchronous.

- ## Collaborative Editor: Show Other Users Cursor Position
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/collaborative-editor-show-other-users-cursor-position/1862
- A widget decoration is the easiest way to do this. Alternatively, use `coordsAtPos` to overlay something over the editor.

- Showing selections/carets of collaborators

- ## Horizontally Scaling the Central Authority
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/horizontally-scaling-the-central-authority/1356
  - By that I mean having more than one process running (potentially on different machines) and then always sending the requests to a given canvas doc to the right process and also handing what has to be done when one of the nodes goes down and things like that.

- Having that many authors in a single document likely never makes sense.
  - üëâüèªÔ∏è What makes more sense when scaling up to many servers, is to filter by URL and have different servers handle different individual documents. 
  - So for example one server can handle all messages for document 4, 10, 15, 21 and 78 and another for document 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 99 and 278.

- ## I believe ProseMirror's OT handles all the intent-preservation requirements in the article. Without being truly distributed, of course, unless you add a vector clock or something.

- ## Rails Gem for Collaborative Editing with ProseMirror
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/rails-gem-for-collaborative-editing-with-prosemirror/3055
  - I also plan to use prosemirror-recreate-steps 11 to handle a client who goes offline for a long period with uncommitted changes. 
  - The gem stores old steps, but a client could go offline for long enough that old steps were thrown out - in this case, it would be important to not only recover the changes, but support some type of interactive merging. 
  - Again though, this likely would require UI which would have to be implemented by library users. 
  - How has this been handled by others?
- prosemirror-collab‚Äôs OT algorithm isn‚Äôt ideal and wastes a lot of bandwidth retransmitting steps unnecessarily - but it‚Äôs basically possible to implement any OT algorithm on top of prosemirror.
  - For rails-collab, I rewrote the collaboration algorithm based on Apache Wave/Google Doc‚Äôs approach to OT. 
  - I‚Äôve actually extracted that into an npm module
  - https://github.com/benaubin/prosemirror-collab-plus
- If you‚Äôre not doing collaborative editing, you need to somehow generate the diffs yourself. 
  - Manuscripts app released a package to handle this 
  - https://gitlab.com/mpapp-public/prosemirror-recreate-steps
  - We‚Äôll likely be using prosemirror-recreate-steps to handle syncing after offline editing & branching
- However, we decided to avoid interactive merging if possible - the hard part is designing a UI/UX for conflict resolution that makes the process intuitive & painless for non-technical users. Git conflicts are a headache for developers - it‚Äôs not something that we want to force our writers to deal with, if possible.

- üëâüèªÔ∏è Steps need to get stored to a) catch clients up who feel behind due to a network issue or b) map a step targeting a past version of the document to apply to the current version (‚Äúrebasing‚Äù). 
  - But steps are really only useful short term - for long term history, your approach of storing the entire document is likely better for long term diffing - having to rollback the document via steps sounds painful.
- The gem approach stores steps in the database. 
  - In reality, for collaborative editing, you only need to store up to the oldest unconfirmed steps.
- Our standalone service keeps steps in memory and (at least right now) only persists the most recent version of the document. 
  - Basically, an app starts a session by providing a serialized document to our server. 
  - We spin up a V8 isolate and clients use a session key to connect to our gateway. 
  - Later, your the app issues an HTTP request to get the edited document.

- ## What is the difference between ProseMirror, and Quill + ShareDB?
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/what-is-the-difference-between-prosemirror-and-quill-sharedb/879
  - I have a product that relies on collaborative editing for which I use Quill and ShareDB.
  - Did Prose Mirror write its own operational transforms library or is it using ShareDB? ShareDB should handle syncing of all the operations so the main thing left is to sync the cursors, using Quill‚Äôs cursor module.

- ProseMirror doesn‚Äôt use ShareDB, it has its own collaborative editing system (not based on OT, strictly speaking).

- I‚Äôve never done it before, but my impression (please anyone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) is that you should simply save the editor state in JSON to your DB of choice (Firebase, ShareDB, Fauna, etc) and update the editor state on the client(s) whenever there is a change of the state.

- I‚Äôve read your article about collaborative editing on prosemirror, and I think you‚Äôre confused when you say that one of the features of OT is that ‚Äúno matter in which order concurrent changes are applied, you end up with the same document.‚Äù
  - That explains why in this thread and in other articles on the internet, Prosemirror has been understood as a different model from the OT. 
  - It is true that many models like ShareDB require convergence in different orders of operations. 
  - But if you check the OT literature, you will see that there are other undo-do-redo type algorithms, like GOT, which are still OT after all, since as the name suggests, they somehow ‚Äútransform operations‚Äù.
