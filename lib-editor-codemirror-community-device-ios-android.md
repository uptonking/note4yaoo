  - codemirror‚Äôs blur happens after a 10ms timeout, making it the last event, occurring after my event
- There are several types of interactions that will cause the editor to lose and then immediately regain focus (people implementing buttons that steal focus on mousedown but then immediately move it back to the editor, our own kludge for dealing with Android inappropriately closing the virtual keyboard in some situations). This timeout tries to isolate code tracking focus state from that kind of phantom(ÂπΩÁÅµÔºõÂπªËßâ) focus changes.
  - If you want to directly track DOM focus state, I‚Äôd recommend using a DOM event observer rather than an update listener. Those get the raw DOM events.
