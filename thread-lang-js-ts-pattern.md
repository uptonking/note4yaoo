- ## Did you know that JS modules are the fastest way to create a singleton in JavaScript?
- https://twitter.com/browsermage/status/1718374661585547579
- I alway create db.js/log.js and import to module i wanted to use. I dont create instance, just use module as singleton. I know not good for unit testing but dont forget you can mock modules too.

- ## I think I have a nice pattern for being able to add extensions without an JS, 
- https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1687512185201893376
  - which should make this pretty unique in the ability to drop into plain HTML contexts
  - https://github.com/justinfagnani/codemirror-elements
  - A set of CodeMirror custom HTML elements

- This is amazing! Very unique way of packing extensions using declarative syntax, and lets you circumvent needing to load all extensions then enable / disable them ... I may need to steal this for Rhino!!

- I am curious how you worked around the getSelection API not working if you're rendering the editor in the shadow DOM, I faced it with ProseMirror / TipTap.
  - Does CodeMirror use getSelection()?
  - I imagine it would for highlighting and transforming

- ## JS challenge: async task with concurrency limit
- https://twitter.com/thdxr/status/1686856181745111040
  - you have an async function `process(item)` , like `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000))` .
  - you need to process all items
  - it needs to be done concurrently, but not more than 25 at a time
  - collect items with errors

    - Turns out that with a couple of modifications it can support async iterables too

  - Promise queue with concurrency control

- https://github.com/tannerlinsley/swimmer /js
  - async task pooling and throttling utility for JS

- Let's not forget about good old async semaphore primitive, a simple and effective way to limit concurrency. Plenty of implementation out there

- isn't this literally the @milliondotjs demo?
  - yes. the bottleneck here is the concurrent thing tho, million would only help with dom stuff.

## üí° [Which has better performance in JavaScript: a switch or a lookup table?](https://twitter.com/kadikraman/status/1680886385010528256)

- ÂæÖÁ°ÆËÆ§: You can speed up the lookup access, by checking if it's a property first by using `name in obj`

- I would hope the switch stmt given the compiler knows the choices will never change. Even if you moved the object creation out of the loop.

- The magic of JS, they probably optimize for switch because of the high usage compare to lookup. Note that a lookup has an upfront init cost which makes it useless on small datasets. Bottom line, a constant (0(1)) vs O(n) is a no-brainer.

- ## The goal is to have an ordered list of unique items or in other words, a sorted map.
- https://automerge.slack.com/archives/C61RJCM9S/p1692837509469869
  - There are three approaches so far

```JS
// s1
list = ["alice", "bob", "marta", "stephen"]

// s2
names = {
  "alice": { order: "938fcn389" },
  "bob": { order: "fn38fk309" },
  "marta": { order: "b38v03mdo" },
  "stephen": { order: "sl3uvmt03" }
}

order = ["fn38fk309", "b38v03mdo", "sl3uvmt03", "938fcn389"]

// s3
names = {
  "alice": { order: "1" },
  "bob": { order: "3" },
  "marta": { order: "4" },
  "stephen": { order: "2" }
}
```

- s1
  - In this approach we have a normal array. 
  - Everytime we synchronize / merge changes into the array we check if there are duplicates and then we remove the duplicates starting at the end so only the first unique entry is left in the array.
- s2
  - Here we use a names mapping where the keys are the names itself and the values are objects with an order field. The order field contains a random id.
  - Everytime a name is added we do the following steps to validate
  - Now if n peers do these steps at the same time with the same name and then merge their changes they will end up with a unique name in the mapping and an order list with n - 1 unused order ids.
- s3
  - Here we use an increasing order number to determine the order of the names.
  - If we see duplicated order numbers we sort the names according to the alphabet and then we update the order numbers accordingly
- As all of these solutions are not really perfect

- ## Goal: Allow the user to select items in a list.
- https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1668946224198680578
  - Three state approaches, from worst, to best:
  - 1. list and selectedList üëé
  - 2. list and selectedIds üëé
  - 3. list with a selected property üëç
  - Principle: Store related data in one array. This simplifies and avoids out-of-sync bugs.
  - I should have added a 4th option: Store the selected ids in an "map" object. This is a fine option too. The map makes it efficient to check if a given record is selected.

- Adding a "selected" field to the User model kind of breaks seperation of concerns. Like beeing selected is not an attribute of a User but knowing which items are selected is an attribute of the list.
So IMO option two is the cleanest - but as always there is no right or wrong here

- i have a strong preference for lookup maps
