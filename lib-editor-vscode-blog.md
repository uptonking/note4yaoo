# server/remote
- 对我来说 vscode 最好用的功能，remote dev 是闭源的。
  - 当然你可以扒压缩混淆过后的 js 源码。

- [Visual Studio Code Server](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/vscode-server)
  - The Visual Studio Code Server is a service you can run on a remote development machine, like your desktop PC or a virtual machine (VM). 
  - It allows you to securely connect to that remote machine from anywhere through a local VS Code client, without the requirement of SSH.
  - The VS Code Remote Development extensions install a server on the remote environment, allowing local VS Code to smoothly interact with remote source code and runtimes.
  - We now provide a standalone "VS Code Server, " which is a service built off the same underlying server used by the remote extensions, plus some additional functionality, like an interactive CLI and facilitating secure connections to vscode.dev.
  - Access to the VS Code Server is built in to the existing code CLI.
  - an instance of the server is designed to be accessed by a single user.
  - hosting it as a service is not allowed, as specified in the VS Code Server license.
# license
- [Differences between the repository and Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Differences-between-the-repository-and-Visual-Studio-Code)
  - Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with Microsoft specific customizations, including additional source code and extensions, released under a traditional Microsoft product license.
