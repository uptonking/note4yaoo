- ## 

- ## Algorithm question (I have no idea). Given a rectangular plane and a set of rectangles on it, find the “nicest” place for a new rectangle with a given size.

  - By “nicest” I mean “where you would place it” — ideally in the middle of the largest free space. Can’t move other rects.
- this is at least similar to the "pole of inaccessibility"
  - https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel
  - A fast algorithm for finding polygon pole of inaccessibility, 
  - the most distant internal point from the polygon outline (not to be confused with centroid), implemented as a JavaScript library. 
  - Useful for optimal placement of a text label on a polygon.
