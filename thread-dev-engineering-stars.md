- ## How I pivoted from an object-oriented programming style to a functional programming style
- https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1426191017968119813
  1. I stopped attaching behavior to objects. My objects are merely data structures.
  2. I create pure functions.
  3. I pass primitives/plain objects (with no behaviors) to these functions.
- I also do this in conjunction with my shift to "vertical slice" type architecture (vs the old n-tier/onion approach).

- ## If I want to create animations for video (nothing too complex: animated diagrams, simple illustrations) should I go straight to After Effects or are there more scoped-down tools to learn instead?

  - Remotion is a suite of libraries building a fundament for creating videos programmatically using React.
  - Leverage web technologies: Use all of CSS, Canvas, SVG, WebGL, etc.
  - Leverage programming: Use variables, functions, APIs, math and algorithms to create new effects
  - everage React: Reusable components, Powerful composition, Fast Refresh, Package ecosystem
- PPT -> Video ?
  - not a bad option
- Really depends on what you mean by complex... sometimes Keynote is enough for me
- Rive also exports video and png sequences.
