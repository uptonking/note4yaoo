- ## How to quickly find out when debugging if an array of objects has duplicates
- https://twitter.com/AndaristRake/status/1505169709657997314
  - arr.forEach((el, i) => (el.__i = i))
  - and just inspect arr if some elements share the __i after that
- new Set(arr).size === arr.length
  - ye, the set thing is useful too but in this case i specifically have wanted to know **which** item is the duplicate

- ## @replayio is an elegantly simple product, but I think it gets at some really deep ideas about the human psychology of debugging
- https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1438152748449636360
- A question that has always fascinated me: why is print debugging so popular? Like, there are nice fancy step-based debuggers, but most devs just use print statements most of the time. Why?
  - One idea could be: we don't need fancy tools! Print debugging is simple 

    - and it's good enough to get the job done. People don't want to bother learning fancy tools.
    - Maybe some truth to that, but I don't think it's the main reason...

  - IMO, a main reason is that print debugging is actually *better* than step-based debugging in one key area: *showing time in space*.

    - With print debugging, I see what my program did from start to end; 
    - I can "scrub through time" by just scrolling up and down in the terminal.

- In contrast, in a step-based debugger, I'm stuck at one moment in time. 
  - It's hard to have a sense of place: where am I in the execution of the code? Gotta be careful not to step forward too far..
  - For me this leads to a vague sense of unease, even if I'm not consciously aware.
- The sad thing is, step-based debuggers are better in so many ways! Interactively evaluate code at any point. Explore live, no need to add print statements ahead of time. Etc. 
  - But still, I choose print debugging because showing time in space is the killer feature...
- Finally, this brings us to Replay. 
  - Simple idea: Just get the best of both of these worlds.
  - Like print debugging, it shows time in space. 
  - But way way better: I can actually scrub a timeline, I can see what my UI looked like at any point...
  - But also has all the normal benefits of step debugging. 
  - I can rewind to any point in the running program and interactively debug.
  - Also allows absurd things, like edit a print statement and see the entire log instantly retroactively update 
- They have impressive tech under the hood making this possible, but the dev experience is straightforward. Once you've fully wrapped your head around this idea, normal debuggers just start to feel primitive... can't wait for record-replay to become the new normal

- ## Note to self: If you face complex problems and donâ€™t know where to start, there are three simple things you can do.
- https://twitter.com/hanspagel/status/1438107649330008064
  - Go for a walk and think about the actual problem ðŸŒ²
  - Read a book and learn how others solve it ðŸ“š
  - Start with the tiniest thing you can do *now* ðŸ’ª

- ## Poll: How does your team do daily app development?
- https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1426893559056240645
  1. Call a shared dev environment database
  2. Call a dedicated database for each developer
  3. Call mock APIs
- #1 is common and the obvious default. But it's rarely the right answer.
- Why #2 or #3 are worth setting up:
  âœ… Stability
  âœ… Autonomy
  âœ… Faster iteration and feedback
  âœ… Supports fast, reliable APIs, which leads to fast, reliable tests 
- I'm not surprised simply because 1 is the default. 2 and 3 require extra up-front work, so you've gotta sell management on the need.
- #2 and #3 have an ongoing maintenance cost to take into account (#3 more so than #2) to keep feature parity. But still worth considering as its likely offset by the advantages you mentioned
- I use SQLite locally and move to sql server for production.
- I prefer a static dataset since itâ€™s stable and can be augmented as we find edge cases we need to cover via tests.

- ## How I pivoted from an object-oriented programming style to a functional programming style
- https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1426191017968119813
  1. I stopped attaching behavior to objects. My objects are merely data structures.
  2. I create pure functions.
  3. I pass primitives/plain objects (with no behaviors) to these functions.
- I also do this in conjunction with my shift to "vertical slice" type architecture (vs the old n-tier/onion approach).

- ## If I want to create animations for video (nothing too complex: animated diagrams, simple illustrations) should I go straight to After Effects or are there more scoped-down tools to learn instead?

  - Remotion is a suite of libraries building a fundament for creating videos programmatically using React.
  - Leverage web technologies: Use all of CSS, Canvas, SVG, WebGL, etc.
  - Leverage programming: Use variables, functions, APIs, math and algorithms to create new effects
  - everage React: Reusable components, Powerful composition, Fast Refresh, Package ecosystem
- PPT -> Video ?
  - not a bad option
- Really depends on what you mean by complex... sometimes Keynote is enough for me
- Rive also exports video and png sequences.
