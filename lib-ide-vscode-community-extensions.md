- ## ðŸ”’ [VS Code extensions are less secure than browser extensions or even NPM packages | Hacker News _202406](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40717878)
- VS Code everything is comically insecure. As far as I can tell, if you use VS Code Remote SSH or remote tunnels, the repository you open can execute code on the remote and the local machine, and the remote machineâ€™s configuration can execute code on the local machine. And this is essentially by design, and MS doesnâ€™t care.
  - At least VS Code in a browser is no less secure than the browser itself, at least as far as attacks against the client are concerned.
- You're describing what is a feature of remote tunnels, though. Ability to executing code and commands is the entire point.
  - By default no local code execution is allowed when you open an unknown workspace btw: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust
