- ## I have been looking forward to introducing this change to @ag_grid since I joined!!

  - Provide a TData generic parameter to colDef and the field will be fully typed, including deeply nested properties!  
  - Will land in the next major (v30)!
- Mixing dot paths property names like `path.to ` with nested objects is not supported by the field property. 
  - You would need to have a value getter for an object like that.
