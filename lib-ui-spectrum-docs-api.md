- The `Collection` interface provides a generic representation for many types of collections. 
  - The collection is read only (immutable), and sequential (ordered). 
  - Each item has a unique key that identifies it, which can be used to access items. 
  - It's like a combination of an array and a map: you can iterate over items in a well defined order, and also access items by key.
