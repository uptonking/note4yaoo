  - When a UI library gets popular, every app starts to look the same. How do we solve this? Introducing Styles.
  - Start with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. 
  - Add a style, including shapes, icons & animations. Apply your colors.
- you can now swap the icon library, replace react-hook-form and even choose framer motion instead of CSS transitions.

- How are you doing these cool videos?
  - A combination of Screenflow for recording and editing. Canva for text animations. I build custom scenes with framer motion for the component animations

- I understand the concern, but standardized design systems across different products is actually more helpful for the end user. Often times creativity can compromise UX Controversial opinion, I know
