- ## Immutable software means people *can* create workflows, can learn, become experts, and optimize their experiences through automation. 
- https://twitter.com/andrestaltz/status/1433782109458649102
  - Software should become a foundational building block for productivity habits, not a "service" that changes every year. 
  - SaaS has poisoned software.
- There is now a real opportunity for the "please don't change this software anymore" monetization model, simply because the pursuit of endless ROI drives business to force bloat onto the same piece of software. This has to stop, but under capitalism, it cannot stop.
  - This is the reason why FOSS alternatives are rightfully filling the gap, because SaaS is making software become worse over time.

- ## 每次想尝试一些 toB 的 SaaS 服务，经常遇到 Pricing 页面不明示价格只有 Contact us。
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1518505264693264385
  - 网站注册页面填完后不是直接创建账号而是告诉你“我们的销售会联系您”。
  - 转头我就去用了竞品，真不明白这种关起门做生意的互联网产品的商业逻辑。
- 很多人都在说传统的 toB 包含定制的业务，可惜和我吐槽的不是一回事。我肯定是不会去用这类产品的，我会去尝试的都是标准化的、不包含定制的、不是只面向 KA 客户的 SaaS 产品。
  - 那些还会驻场的“SaaS”在我眼里只是外包而已，算不上互联网产品。不过跑题跑的很精彩。

- 看过一些分享文章，说0-2万客单价适合PLG，product_led growth模型， 2-30万时候marketing驱动增长模型，30万以上的适合SLG了。
  - 那企业实现业绩增长，有一个很重要的方向是缩短销售周期，把原本需要3个月成单的，通过线上数字化缩短，比如就像这种注册完后直接下单购买或者创建账号了。

- 2B的销售流程长，付钱的人和最终使用的人很多时候不是同一个人，所以注册了给开了账户也没太大意义，最后还是要搞定付钱的人才行。
  - 另外买产品的还有可能是中间商，采购之后再转卖给客户赚差价，所以不更加能明盘，
  - 要都明盘的话，终端客户百度一搜发现厂家卖2万，中间商收了他20万，还不当场骂娘。

- 1. 这类公司是比较传统的 sales driven company，sales team 的人会比 R&D 多很多，按业绩提成。
  - 一般会有一个讨价还价的过程，上来会给个很高的报价，sales 心里有个底价，最终能谈到多低就看双方谈判能力了，每个客户协议的价格都不一样。所以官网既不能写最高价吓跑客户也不能写最低价明盘。
  - 2. ToB 服务最后更多 cost 不一定在于产品本身，而是 customer support，有时候 contract 里售后项目或者 SLA 都会很大程度影响价格。
  - 3. ToB 做得大了可能并不在意中小散客，更喜欢稳定的大客户，这些大客户的合同大都是定制化的
- 另外还有几个场景可能导致这种问题
  1. 系统模块化区分歧视性定价的，需要专家团队根据用户需求选择模块，对于不同的需求开不同的模块，几十个模块很难列出，那自然很难给出一个平衡的价格。
  2. 另外就是客户的歧视性定价，跟商场招商类似，战略客户就会给很低的价格，反之价格极高，这个都是很正常的。
- 不是sales driven，是commission driven😂 不是显示价格是为了保护客户
- 一般大客户，金融行业居多。

- 感觉是中国特色，国外的服务几乎没遇到过不写清楚价格的
  - 国外也有很多的，比如基本上所有商用的lisp的ide价格都是不透明的， 比如 lispwork 或者allegro

- 首先纠正你一下，这些并不是“互联网产品”…
  - 本来toB的逻辑就与toC完全不同，而你是一个C， 本来你也不是目标用户，做你这单也不见得赚钱。
  - toB 业务价格歧视是很常见的，所以最新的价格经常不方便公开，尤其不能让竞品知道…

- 以前我在金蝶实习的时候，老大对销售讲过一句话：“这个单四百万也能做，两百万也能做。客户要是拿得下来，两百万也可以。”
  - 我亲身经历的最夸张的是1200万的报价，最终90万成交

- 有可能你不是目标客户 记得前几个月某行业最大的SaaS企业交流 我问他们 你们怎么不做线上渠道 连个淘宝店都没有 他们来了句: 个人客户赚不到钱 还不如不做.... 他们走线下赚的盆满钵满

- B端业务，就有可能会招标，采购，你把价格都搞透明了，里面的操作空间就没了，你怎么跟有操作空间的竞争对手竞争。。。除非是单价很低的产品。。。国情了。

- 从来不写明价格！就让他们烂着吧，会有透明、坦诚的服务商取代他们的！
  - 不会的，这是行业规则，公开标价就相当于砸所有人的饭碗（包括买家）

- 看菜下饭的路子，同样的产品和服务能谈出不同的价格

- 呃，我就是这么做的，不过我会给试用，要继续用需要加客服。这么做是因为客户量很少，其次他用不了全部功能，最后是我希望和客户深入交流，进一步挖掘细分需求和改进产品

- 根据客户预算进行pricing😂

- ToB的核心就是支持、服务以及 price discrimination. 
  - SLA和整合路径不一样价格就会天差地别，直接把价钱放上刷卡的是toC 产品呀

- 互联网模式本身就是toC兴起的，对到B端，特别是大型机构，定制化是必须的，所以统一定价根本无从谈起。

- 因为不是对所有人开放，B端要的是客户质量

- 日本50%以上也是这样（感觉50%说少了

- 他们最终用户是商业客户，而不是散客，销售直接联系，方便挖掘更深层次的需求。
  - 不直接明示价格，有利于利润最大化，也可以保护代理商的利益。
  - 这种行为背后有商业逻辑存在的

- ## In talking with folks about Reactiflux, pretty frequently I get asked about how we handled growth. 
- https://twitter.com/vcarl_/status/1488242326157807619
  - The weird truth is that, we didn't really do anything in particular other than not fuck up the position we were in
  - We were ~ the only chat community for React for a good number of years.
  - we moved to Discord after Slack shut down invites due to the high member count(funny comparison: slack showed us the door at 7k total members, requiring us to find somewhere else or pay $5/head. on discord, we now have 170, 000, with about 13k online at peak)
  - Two of our best decisions: Crowning members who had distinguished themselves as "MVPs", and adding a #​jobs-advice channel. Playing a part in these have been my proudest contributions to the JS ecosystem, if small.
  - It's not really a helpful story for people trying to grow their community though. "Just tie yourself to a rocket and be a role model for 7 years, " but it worked pretty well for Reactiflux
  - I guess it is worth mentioning, I followed a similar process for creating and managing Nodeiflux, a sister server focusing on Node.js. It's much smaller, but it still has 10k members and ~1.5k online, with a small but dedicated crew moderating

- ## 我突然发现微软才是那个老老实实在做生产力工具的公司, 苹果天天把生产力工具挂嘴上但其实好像没做什么啊...
- https://twitter.com/Cailurus/status/1426877534914838528
- 微软说生产力，是现在只有这个能赚钱了……
  - 苹果说生产力，是现在只有这个还没赚到钱…..
- 苹果相比直接做一堆软件，更多的是为开发者提供环境吧。
  - 开发者环境：Xcode，不支持 AMD/Nvidia 显卡的图形，功能稚嫩的 Swift UI 和不再改进的 UIKit。
- 缺啥喊啥，没毛病
- 最佳苹果开发者巨硬

  - 亚马逊也不客气，立刻宣布将所有官方客户端（见下图）全部分叉，移植到 OpenSearch，自己来维护，双方都在准备完全脱钩

- ## 创业公司向投资者和用户介绍自己的 PPT，叫做 Pitch Deck。
- https://twitter.com/ruanyf/status/1420926087735824387
  - [Pitch Deck Hunt](https://www.pitchdeckhunt.com/) 这个网站收集了150多家著名公司早期的 Pitch Deck，可以用来当作借鉴的模板

- ## Now we have Slack, Discord, Gitter, Microsoft Teams, and Atlassian Stride.
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15191612
  - I'm not sure when chat rooms became a business tool. 
  - Personally, I find myself distracted more than anything from all the notifications these apps cause, I get less done.
- I wouldn't describe them as "chat rooms" exactly, because they have direct messaging and audio/video calls, etc. They are generalized communication tools geared towards synchronous communication. Email is async.
  - Without defending Slack (because I have reservations about it too), your coworkers should stop being mad you're not online, that isn't Slack's fault.

- ## 苹果今天公布的财报说，它有7亿的付费订阅用户。这太惊人了，应该是全球最大的在线服务提供商了。

  2.  Find someone offering that on Fiverr + agree a price
  3.  Land clients using email, LinkedIn + cold calls
  4.  Charge 2-3x the price you pay the freelancer

- ## I'm taking the rest of the year off to work on @tldraw full time. 
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1419048412431933441
  - Turns out there's a lot of enthusiasm for an open source hackable SVG-rendered drawing tool. 
  - My goal is to get it the entire architecture open and toot tooting by the end of the year.
- What do I mean by architecture? 
  - I'm starting off with a slice-and-dice, separating the current Next.js app into a layered architecture that allows other folks to build on either the app or the renderer.
- What about hackable? 
  - The renderer (a React component) is "shape agnostic", meaning that it relies on the implementation to provide it with both the document and the tools to interpret the document. 
  - This makes it *very* easy to modify existing shapes or add new ones.
- The app layer is also going to be a NPM module: essentially the current @tldraw app published as a React component that you'll be able to embed it in any React project. 
  - Control the document either through props or through an imperative API, respond to events—even theme it!
  - The app layer will include a basic set of shapes and tools, just like @tldraw does now. 
  - Want to experiment with a custom shape, or change the way things work? Smash that fork button and have a play.
- The site (http://tldraw.com) is going to be just one example of how the component can be used. 
  - Features such as file management, multiplayer collaboration, and cloud-backed documents can all be managed at this level.

- ## Cloudflare 官网罕见发文，抨击亚马逊云服务出口带宽太贵。
- https://twitter.com/ruanyf/status/1418792375405613056
  - 它给了一张详细表格，列出它拿到的带宽批发价与亚马逊的零售价之间的对比。
  - 结论就是，在美国，亚马逊的带宽价格是批发价的80倍。
- 还好吧，微软的更贵，一个IP每月都好几刀呢
- 亚马逊太黑, 贵不说, 还很鸡贼, 很多扣费项目藏的很深, 就算不用了, 也还在偷偷的扣着你的钱.
- cf自己搞个云吧，已经白嫖它的proxy很久了，如果不是它的proxy，我的翻墙服务器需要经常更换。所以很想补偿一下这样的良心厂家。
- 真得贵得离谱，比do/linode贵太多了，和我用的cc家小鸡$3有5000G就更夸张了
- 服务器资源卖的便宜，赚你流量钱
- 大陆的流量价格是AWS的3倍以上。

- ## One thing I've consistently had to relearn in developer marketing:"Talk benefits, not features" doesn't work!
- https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1361279902889086980
- Developers are sick of vague promises and wary of black boxes.
- Instead:
  - Demo - reach Wow! in <10 mins
  - Explain how it works
  - Show how real companies use in prod

- ## webpack sponsored: In November 2020, 28 backers joined ( @EasyAgile , +27) - you are the best! Raising hands We received $13, 996 from 281 backers and we spent $15, 651 on . Our current balance is $10, 116.
- https://twitter.com/webpack/status/1333751566004838401
- In May 2021, 20 backers joined ( @mayhemBCN , @lucamezzalira , @tu4mo , +17) - you are the best! 🙌 We received $26, 056 from 273 backers and we spent $17, 044. Our current balance is $60, 138.

- ## What are some good examples of sponsorware done right? 
- https://twitter.com/mattgperry/status/1410122128037486594
  - I'm looking closely at @steveruizok (glob) but it feels like a tricky thing to get right.
- @tiptap_editor v2 by @_ueberdosis is a great example imo, launched early to backers, after 5k/mo released publicly
  - Thanks for the mention! Let me know if you have any questions, we’re on our way to double down on Sponsorware.
- Lots of thoughts here! I think sponsorware works great with dev log content where that sponsorware covers the secondary/“try it yourself” content. As long as the open content is good, you can build that audience/support without shilling
  - For tldraw the sponsored content is an app, but I could imagine a blog where interactive examples or additional code samples are all gated like that.
  - If everything is aligned, it’s a great motivator: make new stuff, write about it, get new supporters. I’m 100% okay with being lured by good free content into supporting individual devs.

- ## The rationale there is that traffic tends to continue strong until a weekend is hit, 
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1409624431715098627
  - so by publishing early in the week, the weekend hit happens later. 
  - But often I’ll publish on Tuesday because I get busy or forget on Monday
- Same here. Try to publish before usa wakes up but often a bit late 

- ## I love @github 's approach to marketing pages and a pattern that I think Next.js and React can help democratize(民主化)
- https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1407769747954049036
  - 分析了github运营页的布局
- Best DX I’ve seen on a documentation page is from @stripe where they inject your own key on code snippets. We need more pages like that.
- meta-search is here to stay!!!

- ## We @vercel just raised a $102M Series C @ 1.1B on our mission to help build a faster Web, made for everyone. 
- https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1407716317507948549
- Our goals: 
  - 1️⃣ Build the SDK for Web 
  - 2️⃣ Lower the barrier of entry 
  - 3️⃣ Focus on the end-user

- ## 苦读十多年，进入顶尖名校，熟悉前沿技术，进入互联网大厂，拿着 996 的高薪，最重要的工作是：骗人多点一下「继续抽奖」。
- https://twitter.com/shrugged_hi/status/1407037885325484034
- 跟谷歌的那帮人，世界上最聪明的头脑都在绞尽脑汁儿的卖广告 一个意思嘛
- 确实如此～还有咨询公司进入大厂做战略的也都是类似的活儿
- 我觉得应该是【帮忙砍一刀】
- 高级人才的定义：分析什么样的优惠券有更多人点击。
- 日常功课工作：在朋友圈发领导诗歌的赏析
- 有个笑话：推荐算法发展到最后都会给你推服装搭配。所以不如一开始就推送服装搭配
- 哈哈，计算广告。

- ## Apple has now paid over $230 billion to developers since the app store has launched. (Weird I thought customers paid them)
- https://twitter.com/tominniss/status/1401972522325774341
- Or put another way, they've creamed off nearly $100 Billion!
- Same shit for YouTubers. YouTube gets ad Money and pays the creators. At least Apple talks about the Money, they keep for all of this. YouTube Money is still mysterious because its based on multiple things How much you can own
  - I can bet that hosting YouTube is significantly more expressive than the Appstore. So maybe it doesn't make sense for YouTube to provide such data and have people fight them into bringing the rate down, i.e., destroy their core business model.
- Here is why Netflix is not supported in shareplay, and this is also how Apple is preparing for the removal of the anti-steering(操纵，控制) provisions(条款，规定；供应品、粮食)

- ## The whole open source model of relying on donations from individuals, and to a much lesser extent, companies, is really problematic. 
- https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1392201493596446722
  - The pandemic has shown us that it's not sustainable
  - even the most successful projects like webpack and Babel have seen huge declines in funding.
- Building companies around open source can also be problematic though. 
  - It's hard to say when the VC money will run out, 
  - or the company will need to pivot to become profitable in a way that hurts open source users.
- An alternative model is for companies looking to improve a project to hire contributors and pay them to work on it together with members of the project from other companies. 
  - The project can't be owned by any individual company for this to work – all parties need to be equal.

- ## 一直需要一个很好用的财税 SaaS 服务，强付费需求，要不是我不懂行我早下场自己做了。
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1385921039989755906
- 财税的基础逻辑还是简单的，也都比较死，没啥技术难度。
  - 但是第一，企业要合理避税甚至操控报表（部分操控报表的行为也是合法的），财税软件很难做到
  - 第二，各种税法很繁琐，甚至有些标准年年在变，因此将其转化位代码也很繁琐
- 澳新有两个公司做得比较好，MyOB和Xero。业务也很成功。
- 财税太专业了，投下去无底洞。而且它的核心竞争力也不在好不好用。
- 阿里云貌似有相关产品，按照要求记账，自动报税
  - 阿里是抄袭的自记账。太不要脸了。

- ## As a designer & indie maker, I must tell you this: Visual design (read: aesthetic) is the least important thing to focus on. 
- https://twitter.com/philipyoungg/status/1378658135456448513
  - Make it work and focus on UX (onboarding(onboarding是新用户引导流程, 是刺激用户激活的增长手段之一), reduce friction(分歧，争执；摩擦), good contrast). 
  - Visual is the deciding factor when your competitor has equally good product.
- Similar app as Session has similar pricing but make more revenue each month despite having uglier visual design. Why?
  - They have integrations (Todoist, JIRA etc), 
  - available on web (don't need to install app), 
  - they have simple to do list
  - ...essentially reduce friction
- So, stop focusing on logo design, brand name, aesthetic, etc
  - It doesn't matter if your product doesn't solve the problem and have many frictions. 
  - I regret spent a lot of time (even days) designing linear and radial gradient for Session. Twice even (for light and dark mode).

- ## Why is JavaScript hardly taught in any major universities? Based on the current market, it should be 80% of the entire curriculum!
- https://twitter.com/SimonHoiberg/status/1376569844993232902
- JavaScript is a bad programming language for first time learners. Preparing students for a single job makes them unprepared to jump from one task to the other and how to teach themselves. CS is not JavaScript, the other way round.
- JS is bad for teaching theory. Theory doesn't go out of style, so the language used is almost an after thought. Also JS changes WAY to fast and too often. If you know the theory, picking up JS is more a matter of time to learn the syntax. (and the gotchas)

- ## I'm in the market for a ticketing system (eg Zendesk). Ideally one developer-friendly, with a solid API.
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1370831667749863428
- Helpscout is really great. It’s email based from the customer side, whereas Zendesk it feels like you’re talking to help desk with their ticketed emails and I hated it.
- I use Freescout which is free and open source, has extra modules that you can buy, and presumably you can make your own as well, but I haven't tried (uses Laravel)
- Intercom is the best and easiest for both you and the customer. But it's paid and costly with limited API.

- ## SaaS is not passive income. When I stop shipping new features and/or stop marketing, I feel sales slowing. SaaS is something you have to keep working on.
- https://twitter.com/yongfook/status/1369276581567365123
  - The only people who talk about SaaS as passive income are folks trying to sell you their passive income SaaS course!
- It’s definitely not passive income but it also depends on where your top of the funnel(漏斗；漏斗状物) traffic is coming from.
  - I just recently saw a SaaS that invested heavily in content marketing for a few years and now gets traffic on autopilot(自动驾驶).
  - High domain authority = barrier to entry. It would take years for a new competitor to outrank them.
- It can become passive if you hire good people to do those things for you as well as run the day to day things. I think this is really hard for many bootstrapping founders to do.

- ## Startup idea: A social network (let's call it "the web") where people can post digital art, *but* they first need permission ("a licence") from the artist.
- https://twitter.com/AmeliasBrain/status/1368598410673025025
  - Artists can sell permission in various ways:
  - exclusive to one owner or not
  - transferable or not
  - No chained blocks required
- I'm seeing so many cool digital artists post links to their NFT offerings & as much as I hate the blockchain absurdity of it, I've felt like I couldn't blame people for grabbing some of the cash flying around.

- ## Has anybody built a social network for rich people yet?
- https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1357606986066653185
  - It would only work on the very latest, most expensive iPhone.
  - You'd have to buy new hardware every 6 months to prove you are wealthy
- [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) is an iOS application developed by Armin Heinrich and which was distributed using the App Store.
  - I Am Rich was sold on the App Store for US$999.99 
  - The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008

- ## Singapore is pretty great¹ for indie hackers
- https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1355099275252785153
  - No corporate tax up to $100k/yr
  - No sales tax on Int'l Services (incl digital goods)
  - No auditor needed <$1m
  - Took 30 mins and $300 to register co and open bank account!
- Estonia is pretty damn good too and no local residency requirement (I think you can get around it in Singapore, but they're obviously not as keen as Estonia)
- i dont think CXO title is meaningful for companies under 50 people
- Singapore corporate tax exemption is for new companies. Your first 3 years of business only. Still, it’s a nice perk.

- ## Today I'm open sourcing the code that I've made $500K off of
  - https://twitter.com/_rchase_/status/1334619345935355905
  - I want everyone to see how bad it is, 

    - and I hope it inspires someone out there who is worried that they're not a good enough programmer to be able to start a SaaS business.
    - Unfortunately, I don't have time to individually mentor everyone in my DMs
    - Good news is no one individually mentored me either

  - Hint: The next HostiFi won't be built by someone forking this and starting another UniFi cloud hosting service.

    - Start something new. Put your ideas through the meat grinder
    - I think we do well at this in our market. Unlike our competition, we don't just do IT support. 
    - We innovate new solutions and new products for our customers that even our competitors occasionally end up using (or their clients do at least)
    - you’ll be competing with dozens of others (maybe hundreds after this tweet), all racing to the bottom to be “the cheaper HostiFi”

  - I almost gave up and didn't launch HostiFi because I felt I wasn't a good enough programmer. 

    - I was trying to write it with Django and couldn't get it working, 
    - but I kept trying different things until I finally made it work with WordPress and these 2 files.

  - While I know there isn't likely a single answer here, how'd you get your initial couple dozen customers?

    - TLDR; tried lots of stuff, still doing lots of stuff. 
    - First 6 months I didn't get any organic search traffic, after that started to rank 1st page Google for relevant terms like "UniFi cloud hosting"

  - how you come up with this idea ? Have you ever been in networking field already, or faced problem with ubiquiti devices? And what your idea bring as benefits to the users ? 

    - Yes it was “scratch my own itch” 
    - I had discovered the problem because it was something I wanted to do. 
    - I was installing UniFi networks as an IT consultant and wanted to manage them all from one cloud server, but it took a while to figure out how to do it.
    - I had an IT service business on the side and was installing UniFi lots of places, 
    - it didn't make sense to me to buy a Cloud Key every time or manage multiple installs when I could centralize it to one cloud server.
