- ## pgvector is the de facto standard for vectorized processing in Postgres. 
- https://twitter.com/denismagda/status/1726071145235874059
  - But its dominance can be challenged soon by http://pgvecto.rs - a Postgres extension for vector similarity search written in Rust. 
- I doubt that... pgvector has won all the approvals for all the public clouds. This is a cool project but the go-to-market is nearly impossible compared to pgvector

- ## Most discussions of row vs columnar layout I see are pretty abstract.
- https://twitter.com/eatonphil/status/1720453837566197947
  - The impact really only clicked for me when I tried some benchmarks of workloads on in memory data: sort data stored row and column wise, add all cells of one columns stored row and column wise.
- Think about the (1) branches, (2) data dependencies, and (3) memory overhead that row representation creates on loops processing the records. CPUs hate 1, 2, and 3.

- ðŸ’¡ Column layout = compression. Thats the key feature. Columns are all the same type! For instance parquet format. **Uncompressing can be cheaper than reading uncompressed data as CPU are fast** and cache misses (both disk pages and cache lines) kill performance.
  - From my tests, you don't even need compression to get the wins (of most likely: cache locality) on analytics workloads like summing a column. But yes compression is another thing made feasible in columnar layouts.
- Absolutely! Columnar storage basically feel like a disk resident ECS

- I like browsing InnoDB (typical row-oriented db) vs. Kudu (column-oriented, with per-column disk structures, but with a row-wise memrowset ("insert buffer") to see differences.
