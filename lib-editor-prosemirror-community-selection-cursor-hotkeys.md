- ## Prosemirror-virtual-cursor

  - When the cursor is right between two different marks, it will show a little tail to indicate the mark of following input. 
- Under the hood, I hide the native cursor and use `Decoration.widget` to insert a `<span>` element to the cursor position. 
  - Another approach would be calculate the coordinate of the cursor and put an element at that coordinate. 
  - üëâüèª I refactored prosemirror-virtual-cursor and overlay the cursor over the editor.

- ## Marquee Selection & Selecting Multiple Nodes for Dragging

  - This mimics the behavior of selections in a software called Notion.

- I implemented BlockSelection as a plugin that doesn‚Äôt use the window‚Äôs selection at all.
