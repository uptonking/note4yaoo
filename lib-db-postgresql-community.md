- ## Postgres has a lot of problems and the root cause of all of them is an insular(狭隘的, 孤独的, 保守的) core team that rejects improvements. 
- https://x.com/frasergeorgew/status/2025424053226574294
  - The most egregious(极坏的; 令人震惊的) example is the copy on write storage engine which was already outdated when it was first implemented in the 1990s. 
  - Another insane design choice that has somehow never been revisited is one process per session. 
  - PG has become systemically important because for various reasons it has become the default choice for new systems. It would be a good thing for the world if AWS MS and Google would fork it and fix the fundamental problems. Maybe the name Ingres is available?
- I agree with your view that Postgres has some fundamental problems and I think it is yet to be realized for Tier 0 use-cases. However, I don’t completely agree that the core team is insular or that the right solution is for large corporations to fork it.
  - As a side note, every technology has its flaws. The more widely adopted a technology becomes, the more visible its problems are.
- CoW is not appropriate for an operational db like Postgres that needs to be able to support update heavy workloads. It causes explosive write amplification. Undo space is the solution that’s been adopted by everyone but Postgres.
- Undo space? Is that part of slotting solutions?
  - Different approaches to implementing MVCC. Every update in PostgreSQL is an insert - a new tuple is written (sometimes to the same page but not generally) and the old one is marked dead. By contrast, MySQL updates tuples in-place and inserts the old tuple into an undo log.

- postgres isn't cow, it's wal+mvcc just like mysql and everyone else. people revisit the one process per session thing all the time, it would be nice to have threads so the db could support higher connection counts but you can use pgbouncer and be fine
  - agree on process/session, but there are other issues as well for example with wal replication
  - I think mysql binlog type replication also better than postgres stateful wal replication.
- pg supports physical and logical, and they're both wal replication. agree mysql is generally easier to setup and less maintenance than pg_vacuum nightmares

- Process per session is being revisited. Heiki is leading the efforts. Microsoft, AWS, Google are all investing in it

- sth like orioledb will probably become the defacto standard storage engine, and there has been exploration work even in recent years to get rid of process-per-conn, but obv huge regression risk there so will take ages to get right, provided there even is enough appetite for it
  - This is my point though. The pace of change is just too slow - orioledb has been in the works for 5+ years. Separately, I think orioledb is probably too big a unit of change, Oracle style heap with undo space is probably the right evolutionary path for Postgres.

- This topic is very deep and if any of those forks did fork it they'd likely keep it private (e.g. aurora postgres)

- ## Incremental View Maintenance in PG. Not implemented, but a neat page. PG really is going to eat everything, isn't it?
- https://x.com/criccomini/status/1814351383715590382
- Last time I looked into it, it wasn't really useful yet. Limited support for which SQL is supported in incrementally materialized views, and very locking-heavy.

- Its actively being worked on. The development is currently happening as the `pg_ivm` extension already supported by some cloud providers. The plan is to merge it into PG one day when it has high feature completeness for most SQL operations.
# discuss-pg-olap

- ## Lots of buzz lately around the idea of baking OLAP query engines into Postgres. Is anyone working on making this possible on read replicas (only)? 
- https://x.com/gunnarmorling/status/1824521817811226997
  - By definition, analytics workloads don't require ms range data freshness, so I think it's better to offload these queries to separate nodes and keep the precious CPU cycles on the primary for OLTP transactions.
- OLAP on row-based storage will be unimpressive.
  - 🤔 Data would be stored twice, in columnar form for efficient OLAP usage.
- Couldn’t you just run your OLAP queries on the replicas?
  - Sure, but just propagating any data changes to the OLAP engine on the primary will cost CPU and disk I/O.
- Yes, the product I work on, Postgres Distributed (pgd), is coming out with analytics via Delta Lake and using DataFusion. While you can run these analytics queries from any Postgres node, pgd has a concept of a writer leader and read-only routing to avoid the write leader

- ## great to see more posts on table access methods for postgres (I.e. pluggable storage engines)
- https://twitter.com/eatonphil/status/1765456975012282750
  - Here was my take on this topic a bit ago
- So could we use this for audit trails/logs? Those are not use frequently and are only read-only. Even if you have to ship it manually every day to a new table.
  - Yeah, we could. I imagined a use case like where a table is partitioned per day and child tables are converted to road every day to compact the whole partitioned table.

- ## What do you call "dead tuple" in PostgreSQL?
- https://twitter.com/mmeent_pg/status/1764657105825374319
  - when xmax < current xid
  - when xmax < xmin horizon for all ongoing tx or replication 
  - when lp_flags=dead (and space is reusable)
- It depends on what you expect. The answers given don't really provide a correct answer from an internals PoV
  - A tuple is considered dead if the transaction indicated in xmin has aborted, or if the transaction indicated by xmax has committed and has passed the global xmin horizon (or, if you're looking from a visibility snapshot PoV, if the xmin/xmax rules apply within the snapshot).

- ## 实现了 pg wire protocol 的数据库是不是都是 pg 了
- https://twitter.com/leiysky/status/1764242517472752040
- 那种只能算PG生态。DuckDB虽然是 PG wire protocol，但是有 duckdb_fdw 和 pg_quack 给包进来，能让 PG 本体主干直接利用上，所以算是个例外。

- ## [PostgreSQL中三种自增列sequence，serial，identity区别](https://www.cnblogs.com/wy123/p/13367486.html)
- 对于自增字段，无特殊需求的情况下，sequence不适合作为“自增列”，作为最最次选。
  - sequence在所有数据库中的性质都一样，它是跟具体的字段不是强绑定的，其特点是支持多个对个对象之间共享。
  - sequence类型的字段表，在使用CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE old_table的时候，新表的自增字段会已久指向原始表的sequence
  - sequence作为自增字段值的时候，对表的写入需要另外单独授权sequence
- identity是serial的“增强版”，更适合作为“自增列”使用。
  - identity本质是为了兼容标准sql中的语法而新加的，
  - 修复了serial的缺陷，如无法通过alter table的方式实现增加或者删除serial字段
- sequence，serial，identity共同的缺点
  - 是在显式插入之后，无法将自增值更新为表中的最大Id，这一点再显式插入的情况下是潜在自增字段Id冲突的
  - 自增列在显式插入之后，一定要手动重置为表的最大Id
