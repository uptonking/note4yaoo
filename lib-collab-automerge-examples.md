# automerge-v1
- https://github.com/automerge/hypermerge /MIT/ts/archived
  - Hypermerge is a Node.js library for building p2p collaborative applications without any server infrastructure. 
  - It combines Automerge, a CRDT, with hypercore, a distributed append-only log.
  - Hypermerge is deprecated. 
  - Hypermerge is a distributed document store. It draws inspiration from databases like CouchDB and PouchDB
  - hypermerge document is built up by applying a series of changes generated on different clients. 
    - Every time you open a hypermerge document, the system replays all the logs of changes from every client to recreate the document state. 
    - This can be slow and expensive for large documents, but has excellent history-preserving properties and guarantees clients can always return to earlier states or merge new changes as they arrive.
  - Hypermerge stores an automerge document as a set of separate Hypercores, one per actor ID. Each actor ID in the document is the discovery key of a Hypercore, which allows recursive lookup.
  - This strategy works for a small number of documents, but is very slow to synchronize due to the vast number of Hypercores required for a large collection.
  - [Every opened hypercore keeps a file handle open permanently](https://github.com/automerge/hypermerge/issues/69)
  - [Local-first database: Hypermerge | Jared Forsyth.com_202009](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/local-first-database-hypermerge/)
    - It is designed as a fully peer-to-peer data storage system, and is electron/nodejs-only (no browser support).
    - Conflicts are automatically resolved by Automerge, although the exact behavior is undocumented. 
    - Hypercore, the underlying persistence layer, uses hashing to verify consistency (from what I can tell).
    - Both client and server store a full replica of all changes made, and from some preliminary testing, it looks like the constant factor is rather high (the on-disk size increasing by multiple kilobytes when adding a single change to an attribute).
    - it is a research tool primarily, and not meant to be production ready.

- https://github.com/nornagon/autowiki /automerge
  - Autowiki is a tool for creating networked documents.
  - Autowiki is a local-first app: you own all the data you put into it, and your data never leaves your own machine unless you want it to.
  - Autowiki uses automerge under the hood to resolve edit conflicts automatically.
