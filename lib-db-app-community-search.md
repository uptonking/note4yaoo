- MongoDB has an SQL interface these days if you need it
- Seems like all the NoSQL databases eventually implement SQL, maybe we should use EventuallySQL instead NoSQL
- Even DynamoDb has one
- Microsoft's CosmosDB (their DocumentDB clone) has a SQL-like (yes) interface.
- Cassandra added CQL which is very similar to but not exactly SQL.
- Hadoop (and any other Spark data source) via SparkSQL

- I would like SQL better if jOOQ-style libraries were common across every major language. A standardized query language is good, but passing in queries as strings will never not feel wrong to me.
