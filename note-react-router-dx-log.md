# note-react-router-dx-log

# not-yet

- 最新 Link 总是会重复添加 path，如 http://localhost:8999/dashboard/basic/basic/basic
# upgrading
- [v6.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.4)
  - Absolute nested path support
  - Removed the ability for nested route paths to begin with a / 

- [v6.0.0-beta.3 NavLink: replace activeClassName + activeStyle props](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/7985)
  - replace them by allowing either `style` or `className` to accept functions with the active state.
