  - Tiny framework for building models with the event sourcing pattern (events and snapshots) that works in Node.js and the browser
  - Unlike Active Record where entity state is persisted on a one-model-per row database format, event sourcing stores all the changes (events) to the entity, rather than just its current state. 
  - The current state is derived by loading all events, or a latest snapshot plus subsequent events, and replaying them against the entity.
  - Sourced makes no assumptions about how you store your events and snapshots. 
    - The library is small and tight with only the required functionality to define entities and their logic, enqueue and emit events, and track event state to later be persisted.

  - Making Event Sourcing easy
  - Event Sourcing is a data storage paradigm that saves changes in your application state rather than the state itself.
  - After years of using it at Kumo, we have grown to love it
  - Snapshots are not implemented in Castore yet, but we have big plans for them, so stay tuned üôÇ

    - cqrs + es 
    - DDD Aggregate support
    - Integrates with React and Redux for seamless development experience.
  - using events as a source of truth and calculating read models from them.
  - ReSolve implements the write side as a set of aggregates. 
  - The read side is implemented as a set of read models. 
    - ReSolve also implements a reactive extension of the read model concept called a view model. 
    - A view model rebuilds its state on the fly and uses WebSockets to reactively synchronize the state with the client.
  - A saga describes a long running process as a sequence of events.
  - reSolve application stores its data(a chain of immutable events) in a centralized event store, which can be configured to use different underlying data storages through the mechanism of adapters.
  - you definitely can use only backend part of reSolve, it does not assume anything about client part.
  - [A Redux-Inspired Backend. Extending React+Redux ideas to the_201901](https://medium.com/resolvejs/resolve-redux-backend-ebcfc79bbbea)
  - [Snapshots](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/discussions/1791)
    - These are low level methods that event store need to implement, app devs unlikely will call them.
    - Aggregate state is json built by running a projection function as a reducer on event stream.
    - If number of events used is greater than N, aggregate state is saved to event store as a snapshot.
    - Next time aggregate state is built from snapshot forward, so building an aggregate state should read not more than N records from event store (including snapshot).
    - The same mechanism is used for view models.
  - [Snapshot is always delayed by 1 event](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/issues/980)
    - The snapshot is created when reading events, not when persisting
    - Due to the above, the snapshotted state will always be delayed by 1 event until somebody tries to rehydrate the aggregate root
    - Most likely there is no issue there. 
    - Take in mind that snapshot is never used as single source to receive aggregate root (state). Snapshot allows to reduce amount of events, which should be retrieved from eventstore. So, in your case, last event will be used to rehydrate the aggregate root anyway.
  - [Hosting and Scaling?](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/discussions/1770)
    - reSolve local is a node app, so you can host and scale using any container management system.
    - reSolve 0.28 is tested in multi-instance mode, so it should work in the cluster without problems and additional configuration.
    - concurrent writes are kept consistent using optimistic locking. For read model notification, all instances are registered in the event store, and instance that modified event store notifies others, so they can pull new events and apply to the read models.
    - This means that in case of central read model DB, all instances would try to apply the same updates to the read model, but only one would win. This is probably not an efficient approach, but surely - the simplest thing that will work in all cases.
    - Please note that instances can have different configurations, so some of them can deal with write side, some with read side. Also, it is possible that each instance will have its own read model storage (local db).
    - No redis there, just one instance notifies others via HTTP call. This is just poking "go check event store".
  - [Server clustering configuration possible?](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/discussions/1803)
    - we have tested multi-instance config, and, as I feared, it doesn't work correctly with the current version. We have fixed the problem, and fix is likely to be included in the next release.
    - We have released reSolve 0.28_202103. There we have removed event broker process. Now all instances are registered in event store and notify each other without explicit configuration.
    - reSolve app deployed to the cloud is compiled into AWS lambdas, lambda@edge, and many AWS infrastructure elements like app gateways, step functions, aurora db instances etc.
    - So here we are describing how to run "local" express-based reSolve version in a multi-instance cluster. I would not call it serverless. It is mostly stateless, works similar to cloud version, but is not serverless.
  - [Why is mongodb adapters discontinued?](https://github.com/reimagined/resolve/issues/1429)
    - The current main goals of the reSolve framework and cloud platform are high load capability and high performance of the event store and read models. 
    - All reSolve adapters, except for MongoDB, are SQL-based and support operations that are especially useful under high loads, including transactions and lightweight mutexes. 
    - you can write your own adapters, including a MongoDB event store and read model, but you should be aware that they may not meet high load requirements, which is the reSolve cloud platform‚Äôs main focus.
    - The main reasons for MongoDB adapter removal were the lack of transaction support and the absence of the serverless MongoDB implementation at that time. We decided to focus more on the framework's core features and performance and don't spent much time on maintaining various adapters.

  - A reference implementation of an event-sourced system that uses PostgreSQL as an event store
  - Run PostgreSQL, Kafka and event-sourcing-app
  - We can store all changes to the domain object state as a sequence of events in an append-only event stream. 
    - Thus, **event streams will contain an entire history of changes**.
    - But how can we be sure that this history is authentic and error-free? We can use event streams as a primary source of truth in a system.
    - To get the current state of an object, we have to replay all events in the order of occurrence. This pattern is called event sourcing. 
  - The audit trail (also called the audit log) is a chronological record of the history and details of the actions that affected the system. 
    - Event sourcing is an industry standard for implementing audit trail.
  - State-oriented persistence (CRUD) applications store only the latest version of an entity. Database records present entities. 
  - Event sourcing applications persist the state of an entity as a sequence of immutable state-changing events.
  - An entity in event sourcing is called an aggregate.
  - A sequence of events for the same aggregate is called a stream.
  - Event sourcing is best suited for short-living entities with a small total number of events (e.g., orders).
  - For endlessly stored entities (e.g., users, bank accounts) with thousands of events restoring state by replaying all events is not optimal, and snapshotting should be considered.
  - Snapshotting is an optimization technique where a snapshot of the aggregate's state is also saved, so an application can restore the current state of the aggregate from the snapshot rather than from all the events.
  - On every `nth` event, make an aggregate snapshot by storing an aggregate state and its version.
  - The read model is a "denormalized" view of the write model
    - Read models are projections of the system state. Therefore, read models are also known as projections.
  - CQRS is a self-sufficient architectural pattern and doesn't require event sourcing. 
    - But in practice, event sourcing is usually used in conjunction with CQRS. 
    - Event store is used as a write database, and SQL or NoSQL database as a read database.
    - Commands generate events.

  - deepstream is an open source server inspired by concepts behind financial trading technology. 
  - It allows clients and backend services to sync data, send messages and make rpcs at very high speed and scale.
  - records are schema-less, persistent json documents that can be edited and observed. Changes are persisted and synced across clients and saved in cache/storage.
  - events allow for high performance, many-to-many messaging. deepstream provides topic based routing from sender to subscriber, data serialisation and subscription listening.
  - rpc: Clients can register functions to be called by other clients.

- https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize /rust
  - designed to help you interactively explore your streaming data, perform analytics against live relational data, or increase data freshness while reducing the load of your dashboard and monitoring tasks. 
  - Whenever Materialize answers a query, that answer is the correct result on some specific (and recent) version of your data. Materialize does all of this by recasting your SQL queries as dataflows, which can react efficiently to changes in your data as they happen.
  - Materialize can read data from Kafka (and other Kafka API-compatible systems like Redpanda), directly from a PostgreSQL replication stream, or from SaaS applications via webhooks. It also supports regular database tables to which you can insert, update, and delete rows.
