- https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git /7kStar/MIT/202307/js
  - https://isomorphic-git.org/
  - a pure JavaScript reimplementation of git that works in both Node.js and browser 
  - It can read and write to git repositories, fetch from and push to git remotes (such as GitHub), all without any native C++ module dependencies.
    - rather than relying on the `fs` and `http` modules, isomorphic-git lets you bring your own file system and HTTP client.
    - work with LightningFS/BrowserFS/Filer
  - Isomorphic-git aims for 100% interoperability with the canonical git implementation. 
    - This means it does all its operations by modifying files in a ".git" directory just like the git you are used to.
  - ‰ΩøÁî®Ê°à‰æã https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground
  - https://github.com/isomorphic-git/lightning-fs /js
    - I wanted to see if I could make something faster than BrowserFS or filer that still implements enough of the fs API to run the isomorphic-git test suite in browsers.
  - https://github.com/fasiha/isomorphic-gatty /ts
    - Append-only log for isomorphic-git, expected to be used as remote sync for local-first web app
    - Gatty saves a stream of events to a git repo and synchronizes it with a remote git server (e.g., GitHub, Gitlab, Gogs, Azure Repos, etc.). The ‚Äúevents‚Äù are just plain strings that your app generates and understands: Gatty doesn‚Äôt know anything about them.
- https://github.com/creationix/js-git /3.8kStar/MIT/201907/js/inactive
  - A JavaScript implementation of Git.
  - It also enables using git as a database to replace SQL and no-SQL data stores in many applications.
  - https://github.com/es-git/es-git /202012/ts/inactive
    - Git implemented in EcmaScript (a fork of JS-Git)
  - https://github.com/creationix/git-node-fs
    - A node adapter for the fs-db mixin for js-git. This enables access to Git repositories on the filesystem using Node.js.
  - https://github.com/creationix/js-github
    - An implementation of the js-git interface that mounts a live github repo.

  - http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html
  - I can only understand something by implementing it. So, I wrote Gitlet, my own version of Git

- https://github.com/GitoxideLabs/gitoxide /9.1kStar/MIT/202411/rust
  - ü¶Ä an implementation of git written in Rust
  - for the most part, git operations are heavily reliant on memory mapped IO as well as CPU to decompress data, which doesn't lend itself well to async IO out of the box.

  - Implementing git in rust for fun and education
- https://github.com/web3infra-foundation/mega/tree/main/libra /202406/rust
  - a partial implementation of a Git client, developed using Rust.
  - Our goal is not to create a 100% replica of Git (for those interested in such a project, please refer to the gitoxide)
  - A key feature of libra is the replacement of the original Git internal storage architecture with SQLite.

  - https://gitbutler.com/
  - The GitButler version control client, backed by Git, powered by Tauri/Rust/Svelte
  - Git branch management tool, built from the ground up for modern workflows
  - GitButler is a git client that lets you work on multiple branches at the same time
  - GitButler is a Tauri-based application. Its UI is written in Svelte using TypeScript and its backend is written in Rust.
  - ‚ú® Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. 
  - üÜöÔ∏è How do GB's virtual branches differ from Git branches?
    - The branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. 
    - GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory.
    - GitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to.
    - while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.

  - https://www.gerritcodereview.com
  - https://gerrit.googlesource.com/gerrit/
  - Gerrit is a code review and project management tool for Git based projects.
  - Gerrit makes reviews easier by showing changes in a side-by-side display, and allowing inline comments to be added by any reviewer.
  - Gerrit simplifies Git based project maintainership by permitting any authorized user to submit changes to the master Git repository, rather than requiring all approved changes to be merged in by hand by the project maintainer.
  - Gerrit Code Review started as a simple set of patches to Rietveld, and was originally built to service AOSP. 
  - Gerrit 2.x is a complete rewrite of the Gerrit fork, changing the implementation from Python on Google App Engine, to Java on a J2EE servlet container and a SQL database.
  - Since Gerrit 3.x NoteDb replaced the SQL database and all metadata is now stored in Git. The user interface migrated away from GWT to Polymer.
  - [NoteDb Backend](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/note-db.html)
    - NoteDb is the only database format supported by Gerrit 3.0+. 
    - NoteDb is the storage backend for code review metadata. It is based on Git, so code reviews are stored together with the code under review. 
    - NoteDb replaced the traditional SQL backend for change, account and group metadata that was used in the 2.x series
    - Enables simple federation between Gerrit servers, as well as offline code review and interoperation with other tools.

- https://github.com/aergoio/litetree /202003/c/inactive
  - It is a modification of the SQLite engine to support branching, like git
  - Each database transaction is saved as a commit, and each commit has an incremental number
  - We cannot write to the database when we are in a defined commit, writing is only possible at the head of each branch. If you want to make modifications to some previous commit you must create a new branch that starts at that commit.

- https://github.com/GerritCodeReview/jgit /EDL(BSD)/202310/java
  - https://eclipse.dev/jgit/
  - An implementation of the Git version control system in pure Java.
  - JGit 6.0 and newer requires at least Java 11. Older versions require at least Java 1.8.
  - Native symbolic links are supported, provided the file system supports them. 
  - For Windows you must use a non-administrator account and have the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege.
  - JGit can use JDBC, HBase, Cassandra, Bigtable and more and it's thread safe.
  - There are some missing features:
    - shallow and partial cloning
    - support for multiple working trees (git-worktree)
    - using external diff tools
    - git protocol V2 (client side): packfile-uris
- https://github.com/terabyte/jgit /BSD/201104/java
  - https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/
  - JGit is an EDL (new-style BSD) licensed, lightweight, pure Java library implementing the Git version control system
  - A pure Java library capable of being run standalone, with no additional support libraries.
  - Symbolic links are not supported because java does not support it. Such links could be damaged.

- https://github.com/gitblit-org/gitblit /apache2/202311/java
  - http://gitblit.com/
  - pure Java Git solution for managing, viewing, and serving Git repositories. 
  - It can serve repositories over the GIT, HTTP, and SSH transports; 
  - it can authenticate against multiple providers; 
  - Gitblit GO is an integrated, single-stack solution based on Jetty.
  - Gitblit WAR is what you should download if you already have a servlet container available that you wish to use
  - JGit 4.5 release supports GitLFS, this could allow mirroring of repositories using LFS and provide a means for handling LFS files during federation requests.
  - [Support for partial clones? /Êú™ÂÆûÁé∞ _202104](https://github.com/gitblit-org/gitblit/issues/1365)
    - currently partial cloning is not supported.
    - üëâ Gitblit uses JGit underneath. I am not sure, but I think right now JGit does not have support for it, at least not fully.

  - https://fossil-scm.org/home/dir?ci=trunk&type=tree
  - https://fossil-scm.org/
  - A test of the ability of the Fossil DVCS to mirror to GitHub
  - Fossil SCM(Source Control Management) uses SQLite as its database and implements versioning and branching and even merging (which LiteTree doesn't do) on its own, by recording the changes on each item on a separate table.
  - This approach is more complex to implement but a lot more versatile and flexible. Most of times you wouldn't want to version or branch the whole database, but only parts of it.

  - A Git-compatible DVCS that is both simple and powerful
  - Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user interface and version control algorithms from the storage systems used to serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical backends, that may have their own data or networking models‚Äîlike Mercurial or Breezy, or hybrid systems like Google's cloud-based design, Piper/CitC.
  - It combines features from Git (data model, speed), Mercurial (anonymous branching, simple CLI free from "the index", revsets, powerful history-rewriting), and Pijul/Darcs (first-class conflicts), with features not found in most of them
  - üëâ Jujutsu has two backends. One of them is a Git backend (the other is a native one). This lets you use Jujutsu as an alternative interface to Git.
  - All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation
  - The tool is quite feature-complete, but some important features like (the equivalent of) git blame are not yet supported. 
  - Git compatibility pretty much rules out the radically different approaches that might actually be better enough to outcompete it. Like:
    - Patch-based VCS (darcs, pijul)
    - CRDT (live collaboration)
    - Image-based systems (Smalltalk)
    - Features that require the server to do stuff that Git protocol won‚Äôt do, like push notifications
    - In other words, I can‚Äôt imagine leaving Git unless it‚Äôs as big of an upgrade as Git was to SVN. And you can‚Äôt do that while being wire compatible.
  - [Operation log](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/docs/operation-log.md)
    - Jujutsu records each operation that modifies the repo in the "operation log". You can see the log with jj op log. 
    - Each operation object contains a snapshot of how the repo looked at the end of the operation. We call this snapshot a "view" object. 
    - The view contains information about where each branch, tag, and Git ref pointed, as well as the set of heads in the repo
    - The view contains information about where each branch, tag, and Git ref (in Git-backed repos) pointed, as well as the set of heads in the repo,
    - The operation log allows you to undo an operation (jj [op] undo), which doesn't need to be the most recent one. It also lets you restore the entire repo to the way it looked at an earlier point

- Pijul /GPLv2
  - [Pijul is a free and open source (GPL2) distributed version control system](https://pijul.org/)
  - Pijul is instead a CRDT, meaning that independent patches can be applied in any order without changing the result, which makes rearrangement unnecessary, and the system much faster.

  - There is no client authentication. This is meant to be run in an internal network with clients you trust

- https://github.com/mbostock/git-static /201503/js
  - A versioned static file server backed by Git.
  - Go to `http://localhost:3000/HEAD/path/to/file.html` to view a file from the source repository. You can replace HEAD with a specific commit version, or with short names and aliases for commits such as "0ad4156" or "HEAD~1".

- https://github.com/awslabs/git-remote-s3 /apache2/202410/python
  - This library enables to use Amazon S3 as a git remote and LFS server.
  - It provides an implementation of a git remote helper to use S3 as a serverless Git server.
  - It also provide an implementation of the git-lfs custom transfer to enable pushing LFS managed files to the same S3 bucket used as remote.
    - The LFS integration stores the file in the bucket defined by the remote URI, under a key `<prefix>/lfs/<oid>`, where oid is the unique identifier assigned by git-lfs to the file. 
    - If an object with the same key already exists, git-lfs-s3 does not upload it again.
  - The git S3 integration was inspired by the work of Bryan Gahagan on git-remote-s3.
    - The LFS implementation benefitted from lfs-s3 by @nicolas-graves. If you do not need to use the git-remote-s3 transport you are should use that project.

    - Git is the decentralized storage by itself.
    - of course git is decentralised but we still need a clear web repo that people can push upstream. git torrent looks promising
    - NostrGit hosts git servers on a decentralized storage network and uses nostr for everything else
  - [Backend for git repositories](https://github.com/NostrGit/NostrGit/issues/115)

  - https://git-lfs.com/
  - Git extension for versioning large files
  - Git LFS is a command line extension and specification for managing large files with Git.
  - Git LFS source code utilizes Go modules in its build system, and therefore this project contains a `go.mod` file with a defined Go module path. However, we do not maintain a stable Go language API or ABI, as Git LFS is intended to be used solely as a compiled binary utility.

  - Offline-first Database that Syncs with Git
  - GitDocumentDB is compatible with Git that brings us distributed multi-primary databases and efficient CI/CD.
  - The throughput of GitDocumentDB is about the same as Git. It is not as fast as typical databases. Storage size grows when managing many revisions of a document. These are a trade-off for Git features.

  - [Repository Syncing Capabilities _202408](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/git-sync/discussions/24)
    - Is it possible to sync from one source repository to another source repository instead of a local folder? 
    - Hey, this feature is not yet supported since the idea is to create backups from cloud hosted service to your local server.

- https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync /apache2/202505/go
  - git-sync is a simple command that pulls a git repository into a local directory, waits for a while, then repeats. As the remote repository changes, those changes will be synced locally. 
  - git-sync can pull over HTTP(S) (with authentication or not) or SSH.
  - It is a perfect "sidecar" container in Kubernetes - it can pull files down from a repository so that an application can consume them.
  - [Syncing multiple repositories _202103](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/issues/352)
    - I would require to sync 2 repositories to a kubernetes pod.
    - It would boil down to either starting 2 git-sync binaries inside one container or my personal recommendation use separate git-sync containers. That would also split up logging, error reporting to each repository.
  - [Way for syncing multiple repositories & branches? _202009](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/issues/261)
    - Git-sync is more about syncing one specific repo and reference (branch, tag, hash) to a location on disk.
    - Keeping different repositories, branches etc. in sync was not really the main intention.
  - [Cloning a Git repo into the current directory _202210](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/issues/636)
    - Is it possible to clone the git repository into the root directory without creating an additional folder?
    - No, it's not. git-sync is mostly trying to stay in sync with an upstream, which means the local version will change over time.  We use the `--dest` as a symlink so it can be atomically switched, so clients never see a partial state. If you only need a single checkout, I think you can use `subpath` in your app's volumeMount?

# git-storage
- https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/jawn /js
  - a node.js module that allows distributed version control of Tabular Data. 
  - It's connected to the dat project. 
  - It allows you to import tabular data (rows and columns like CSV or TSV) and track how those data change over time
  - manage and track change history in tabular data
  - create historical checkpoints with metadata (e.g., message, timestamp, author)
  - Jawn relies on `hypercore` to handle the core functions around creating merkle chains

- https://github.com/mirage/irmin /ocaml
  - https://irmin.org/
  - Irmin is an OCaml library for building mergeable, branchable distributed data stores.
  - Irmin applies DVC's principles to large-scale distributed data and exposes similar functions to Git (clone, push, pull, branch, rebase).
  - Irmin was created at the University of Cambridge in 2013 to be the default storage layer for MirageOS applications
  - Irmin is not, strictly speaking, a complete database engine. Instead, similarly to other MirageOS components, it is a collection of libraries designed to solve different flavours of the challenges raised by the CAP Theorem.
  - Due the Content-addressable inherited Git-feature, Irmin allows deduplication and thus, reduced memory-consumption. Some functionally persistent data structures fit perfectly on this database, and the 3-way merge is a novel approach to handle merge conflicts on a CRDT-style.
  - it works well for in-memory databases and slower persistent serialization such as SSDs, hard drives, web browser local storage, or even the Git file format.

- https://github.com/datalad/datalad /python

  - DVID is a Distributed, Versioned, Image-oriented Dataservice written to support neural reconstruction, analysis and visualization efforts at HHMI Janelia Research Center. 
  - It **provides storage with branched versioning** of a variety of data necessary for our research including teravoxel-scale image volumes, JSON descriptions of objects, sparse volumes, point annotations with relationships (like synapses), etc.
  - All versions are available for queries. There is no checkout to read committed data.
  - DVID can be used as a **general-purpose branched versioning file system** that handles billions of files and terabytes of data by creating instances of the keyvalue datatype. 
    - Our team uses the keyvalue datatype for branched versioning of JSON, configuration, and other files using the simple key-value HTTP API.
    - DVID currently handles branched versioning of large-scale data and does not provide domain-specific diff tools to compare data from versions, which would be a necessary step for user-friendly pull requests and truly collaborative data editing.
