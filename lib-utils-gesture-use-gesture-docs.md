  - `@use-gesture/react` replaces `react-use-gesture` completely and relies on a universal core,  `@use-gesture/core` that also powers `@use-gesture/vanilla`.
  - The API is 95% the same as before, the main one being the `domTarget` option being renamed to `target`.
  - [breaking changes for v10](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-gesture/blob/main/packages/react/CHANGELOG.md#1000)
