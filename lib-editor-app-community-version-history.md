  - Weâ€™re sick of decade-old version control systems. Git is unapproachable to non-engineers and makes it hard for everyone else to start contributing.
  - When you create a project, you'll get a clean dashboard that shows the active forks of your main Repl and whoâ€™s currently coding on your team. 
  - When starting a new feature or prototype, you can easily make a fresh fork and jump between versions from the Workspace header. Once youâ€™re happy with the changes, you can easily integrate them back in one click. 
  - Projects are backed by Git under the hood, but weâ€™ve flattened the learning curve.

- If you made it so that everyone on the team could see the same inputs/outputs in the AI pane that would be very cool.
  - Replit AI chat is collaborative! you can see messages your teammates sent and how the AI replied

- I'd guess they are using their multiplayer tech that doesn't have merge conflicts. I'm sure there are edge cases where intents are lost. They do have more information than git does when merging, probably as far as near keystroke level, when files were edited/added/deleted, and more.
