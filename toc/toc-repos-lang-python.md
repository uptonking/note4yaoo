  - PostgreSQL, sqlalchemy, poetry
  - All routes are available on /docs or /redoc paths with Swagger or ReDoc.
  - [Can you talk more about how you split queries between aiosql and pypika?](https://github.com/nsidnev/fastapi-realworld-example-app/issues/98)
    - At first I only used raw SQL strings in this project and it worked
    - But reading such code in github was not easy, and also some of these SQL string simply could not be read 
    - So, to fix the first issue, I used `aiosql`, which helped me move all static queries into separate files
    - But dynamic queries were still a problem, so I wanted to use `pypika` for that
  - Could you tell why you chose to work without an ORM?
    - At the time of this project writing, there was no good async ORM for python. The Tortoise-ORM was very young (and remains so), SQLAlchemy did not have support for async, orm from encode also had limitations (for example, m2m fields). 
    - I used to work with SQLAlchemy, and on this project I just wanted to try the other side of working with the database
  - Do you plan to refactor this repository with SQLAlchemy 1.4?
    - Sorry, but no. I'd like to keep current implementation for DB part.
