  - Parseable is a lightweight, cloud native log observability and analytics engine. 
  - It is written in Rust and uses Apache Arrow and Parquet.
  - Parseable uses a simple, index-free mechanism to organize and query data allowing low latency, and high throughput ingestion and query. 
  - It can use either a local mount point or object storage (S3/compatible stores) for data storage.
  - For comparison, Parseable consumes up to ~80% lower memory and ~50% lower CPU than Elastic for similar ingestion throughput.
