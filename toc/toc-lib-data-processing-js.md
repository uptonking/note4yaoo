  - a JavaScript library for query processing and transformation of array-backed data tables. 
  - Following the relational algebra and inspired by the design of dplyr, Arquero provides a fluent API for manipulating column-oriented data frames.
  - Arquero supports a range of data transformation tasks, including filter, sample, aggregation, window, join, and reshaping operations.
  - query over arrays, typed arrays, array-like objects, or Apache Arrow columns.
- https://github.com/uwdata/arquero-sql
  - Arquero-SQL is a SQL backend support for Arquero. 
  - With Arquero-SQL, your data is stored in a disk and can be transformed with a powerful remote machine, suited for big data analysis tasks.
