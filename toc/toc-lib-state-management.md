    - Note that, unlike xstate, State Designer does not adhere to the scxml spec.
  - Write state-charts in a simple declarative syntax.
    - Create both global and local component states.
  - Put simply, a statechart is a beefed up state machine.  
    - The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially state explosion that happens as state machines grow.

    - We recommend moving to nanostores

- reatom /504Star/MIT/202006/ts
  - https://github.com/artalar/reatom
  - Reatom is a blend of the one-way data flow (by flux and global store) and decentralized atoms for deterministic and flexible description of state and its changes
  - Inspired by redux, kefir, effector
  - framework-agnostic: independent and self-sufficient
  - debugging: immutable data, devtools (redux ecosystem support by adapter)
  - synchronous glitch free: resolve diamond problem
  - Why is API so strange, can't it be simpler? to support type check
  - Reatom is built on top of SSoT(single source of truth) idea and attempts to strictly follow it to ensure reliability. 
  - Therefore it prefers immutable global state and other limitations
    - impossible to create cyclic dependencies

- akita /Apache2/2.3kStar/202007/ts
  - https://github.com/datorama/akita
  - https://datorama.github.io/akita/
  - Akita is a state management pattern, built on top of RxJS, 
    - which takes the idea of multiple data stores from Flux and the immutable updates from Redux, 
    - along with the concept of streaming data, to create the Observable Data Stores model.
- cerebral /MIT/1.9kStar/202005/js
  - https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral
  - https://cerebraljs.com/
  - Declarative state and side effects management for popular JavaScript frameworks
  - To handle everything(updating state) from a simple toggle to very complex operations, Cerebral has the concept of sequences. 
    - Sequences allows you to compose functions together into a flow. 
    - sequences are based on function-tree, a project that came out of the initial experimentations in the first version of Cerebral.
- effector /2.8kStar/MIT/202010/ts

- store /187Star/MIT/202010
  - https://github.com/fabiospampinato/store
  - simple framework-agnostic modern state management library.
  - Thanks to usage of `Proxy` s you just have to wrap your state with store,

  - A small, opinionated, state management library based on reducing observable events into state
  - 吸收了redux和mobx的优点
  - event-reduce also has support for time-travelling debugging with the Redux DevTools.
  - What if my application is more complicated than a single counter?
    - I'd recommend putting your events in their own class
  - Chances are, your application is going to be even more complicated than even a list of counters grin. 
    - You're going to need more model classes, and you're going to want to scope events to particular child models. 
- pulse /225Star/MIT/202010/ts
  - https://github.com/pulse-framework/pulse
  - Global state and logic for reactive JavaScript applications. 
  - Supports frameworks like React, Vue, and React Native.

- https://github.com/oslabs-beta/ZusTime
  - With ZusTime you can inspect your Zustand store and application by stepping both forward and backwards in your code, allowing you to visualize snapshots of state at various points in time. 
  - This type of debugging tool limits the need for countless console logs and prevents you from having to run your application over and over again
# event pub/sub
- EventEmitter /3kStar/Unlicense/202001/js/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/Olical/EventEmitter
  - brings the power of events from platforms such as node.js to your browser
  - 对应npm包 https://www.npmjs.com/package/wolfy87-eventemitter
- PubSubJS /3.3kStar/MIT/202008/js
  - https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS
  - Dependency free topic-based publish/subscribe library written in JavaScript
  - PubSubJS has synchronisation decoupling, so topics are published asynchronously.
  - PubSubJS is designed to be used within a single process, and is not a good candidate for multi-process applications (like Node.js – Cluster with many sub-processes).
  - Use "constants" for topics and not string literals. PubSubJS uses strings as topics
- https://github.com/choojs/nanobus
  - We had the requirement for a * event to catch all calls, and figured we could improve the file size at the same time. 
  - This library is about 1/3rd the size of Node's version.
  - Are these emitters asynchronous? No.
- https://github.com/faye/faye
  - /4.3kStar/Apache2/202008/js
  - Faye is a publish-subscribe messaging system based on the Bayeux protocol.

- https://github.com/ganapativs/pure-cache
  - tiny in-memory JavaScript cache with near realtime cache expiry feature
- https://github.com/bpmn-io/scroll-tabs
  - ScrollTabs adds scroll buttons on the left and right side of the tabs container if not all tabs are visible. 
  - It also adds a mouse wheel listener on the container.
- https://github.com/elninotech/uppload
  - image uploader with 30+ plugins
- https://github.com/garronej/evt
  - EventEmitter's typesafe replacement
  - Why would someone pick EVT over RxJS:
    - RxJS introduces a lot of abstractions. It's a big jump from EventEmitter.
    - RxJS tends to be quite verbose.
    - With RxJS It is often needed to resort to custom type guards, the filter operator breaks the type inference.
    - It could be months before RxJS it eventually supports Deno.
    - No official guideline on how to integrate RxJS with React.
  - EVT is an attempt to address all these points while trying to remain as accessible as EventEmitter.

# signals
- https://github.com/preactjs/signals /ts/实现不依赖proxy
  - Signals is a performant state management library with two primary goals
    - Make it as easy as possible to write business logic for small up to complex app
    - Integrate into frameworks as if they were native built-in primitives
  - Signals can be accessed directly and your component will automatically re-render when the signal's value changes.
  - [Reactive/Store-like primitive](https://github.com/preactjs/signals/issues/4)
  - [Proposal: Multi-value Signal using bitmaps (bit arrays)](https://github.com/preactjs/signals/pull/217)
  - [Reasoning for using prototype over classes](https://github.com/preactjs/signals/issues/216)
    - It performed better in benchmarks, and avoided cruft resulting from transpiled TypeScript classes
- https://github.com/luisherranz/deepsignal
  - Preact signals, but using regular JavaScript objects
  - DeepSignal works by wrapping the object with a `Proxy` that intercepts all property accesses and returns the signal value by default.
  - This allows you to easily create a deep object that can be observed for changes, while still being able to mutate the object normally.
  - Nested objects and arrays are also converted to deep signal objects/arrays, allowing you to create fully reactive data structures.
  - https://github.com/EthanStandel/deepsignal
    - wrap Preact's Signal model to make it a full state management solution
  - https://github.com/melnikov-s/preact-observables
    - enables the use of deep observable objects for `@preact/signals` supporting objects, arrays, Map, Set, WeakMap and WeakSet

  - A shopping list app using typescript and preact signals

- https://github.com/tldraw/signia /ts
  - Reactive signals that scale, by tldraw.
  - It uses a new clock-based lazy reactivity system that allows signals to scale with complex data-intensive applications.
  - Signia has a global logical clock. This is an integer that gets incremented every time any atom is updated.
  - signia-react实现基于proxy
    - With the native Proxy, all other calls such as access/setting to/of properties will be forwarded to the target Component
  - https://twitter.com/djsheldrick/status/1631572755777830912
    - Signia is like MobX and computed, but with the diffing thing mentioned above, and always-on caching for computeds. 
    - (MobX throws cached values away when there are no active observers). 
    - Signia doesn't use proxies to wrap data.

- https://github.com/WebReflection/usignal
  - A blend(混合，融合) of @preact/signals-core and solid-js basic reactivity API, with API and DX mostly identical to @preact/signals-core but extra goodness inspired by solid-js
  - this library has lazy, non side-effecting, computed values, something @preact/signals-core recently introduced and Solid 2.0 is planning to improve.

- https://github.com/jotaijs/jotai-signal
  - 支持jotai v1和v2

- https://github.com/starbeamjs/starbeam

  - Use normal JavaScript APIs and access patterns. 

- https://github.com/maverick-js/signals /ts
  - a tiny (~1kB minzipped) library for creating reactive observables via functions called signals. 
  - You can use signals to store state, create computed properties (y = mx + b), and subscribe to updates as its value changes

# atom-multi-stores
- https://github.com/Omnistac/zedux /ts
  - A Molecular State Engine for React.
  - Zedux is a multi-paradigm state management tool that features a powerful composable store model wrapped in a DI-driven atomic architecture.
  - Zedux borrows ideas from Redux, Recoil, and React Query. 
  - Zedux takes the unique approach of separating the state layer (stores) from the architecture layer (atoms). This allows for a powerful Dependency Injection model, conceptually similar to Angular's but simpler and more dynamic.
# state-machine
- https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine
  - /7.4kStar/MIT/201807/js
  - A library for finite state machines. xstate也是
  - [web前端为什么很少用有限状态机设计框架？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/278938893)
    - 我觉得区别还是前端树状结构比较明显，所以整个问题可以用决策树（路由）或组件树（vDOM tree）+很简单的局部状态来建模，所以不会有游戏里那种 很大的有限状态机，局部状态用几个变量来存就行了

- https://github.com/thefrontside/microstates
  - Microstates makes working with pure functions over immutable data feel like working with the classic, mutable models we all know
  - A Microstate is just an object that is created from a value and a type. 
  - The value is just data, and the type is what defines how you can transition that data from one form into the next. 
  - Unlike normal JavaScript objects, microstates are 100% immutable and cannot be changed.

- react-tracked /MIT/645Star/202006
  - https://github.com/dai-shi/react-tracked
  - https://react-tracked.js.org/docs/comparison
  - Simple and fast global state with React Context. Eliminate unnecessary re-renders without hassle.
  - Technically, it uses Proxy underneath, and it tracks state usage in render so that if only used part of the state is changed, it will re-render.
  - React context by nature triggers propagation of component re-rendering if a value is changed.
    - To avoid this, this libraries use undocumented feature of `calculateChangedBits` . 
    - It then uses a subscription model to force update when a component needs to re-render.
