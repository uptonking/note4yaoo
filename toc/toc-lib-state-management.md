# agnostic
- redux /MIT/53.7kStar/202005/ts/单向数据流
  - https://github.com/reduxjs/redux
  - https://redux.js.org/
  - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
  - 源码简单，插件丰富，插件有时会导致状态管理变得复杂
- mobx /MIT/22.1kStar/202007/ts/响应式数据流/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx
  - https://mobx.js.org/README.html
  - MobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).
  - Mobx implements TFRP in a glitch-free, synchronous, predictable and efficient manner.
  - mobx isn't pubsub. It doesn't do change detection
- xstate /MIT/12.2kStar/202007/状态机
  - https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate
  - https://xstate.js.org/docs/
  - JS and TS finite state machines and statecharts for the modern web.
- state-designer /472Star/MIT/202107/ts
  - https://github.com/steveruizok/state-designer
  - https://state-designer.com/
  - 主要用于自研的tldraw、perfect-freehand、globs.design
  - library for managing the state of a user interface. 
  - It prioritizes the design experience, making it easy to experiment with ideas, iterate on solutions, and communicate the final result.
  - State Designer is heavily inspired by xstate. 
    - Note that, unlike xstate, State Designer does not adhere to the scxml spec.
  - Write state-charts in a simple declarative syntax.
    - Create both global and local component states.
  - Put simply, a statechart is a beefed up state machine.  
    - The beefing up solves a lot of the problems that state machines have, especially state explosion that happens as state machines grow.

- storeon /1.5kStar/MIT/202009/js
  - https://github.com/storeon/storeon
  - A tiny event-based Redux-like state manager for React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.
- nanostores /1.2kStar/MIT/202201/js
  - https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores
  - A tiny state manager for React, React Native, Preact, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla JS.
  - We released Nano Stores 0.5, a new version of tiny (200-900 bytes) state manager for React/Vue/Svelte, designed to:
    - Move logic from components to stores and separate application logic and UI
    - Support tree-shaking
- reatom /504Star/MIT/202006/ts
  - https://github.com/artalar/reatom
  - Reatom is a blend of the one-way data flow (by flux and global store) and decentralized atoms for deterministic and flexible description of state and its changes
  - Inspired by redux, kefir, effector
  - framework-agnostic: independent and self-sufficient
  - debugging: immutable data, devtools (redux ecosystem support by adapter)
  - synchronous glitch free: resolve diamond problem
  - Why is API so strange, can't it be simpler? to support type check
  - Reatom is built on top of SSoT(single source of truth) idea and attempts to strictly follow it to ensure reliability. 
  - Therefore it prefers immutable global state and other limitations
    - impossible to create cyclic dependencies
- Kel /12Star/MIT/202005/js
  - https://github.com/vijitail/Kel
  - A dead simple, event driven state management library for Vanilla JS apps.

  - [SubState: I abandoned Redux for a Flux/Pub-Sub hybrid](https://medium.com/@t.saporito/substate-why-i-abandoned-redux-26d01419d74b)

- akita /Apache2/2.3kStar/202007/ts
  - https://github.com/datorama/akita
  - https://datorama.github.io/akita/
  - Akita is a state management pattern, built on top of RxJS, 
    - which takes the idea of multiple data stores from Flux and the immutable updates from Redux, 
    - along with the concept of streaming data, to create the Observable Data Stores model.
- cerebral /MIT/1.9kStar/202005/js
  - https://github.com/cerebral/cerebral
  - https://cerebraljs.com/
  - Declarative state and side effects management for popular JavaScript frameworks
  - To handle everything(updating state) from a simple toggle to very complex operations, Cerebral has the concept of sequences. 
    - Sequences allows you to compose functions together into a flow. 
    - sequences are based on function-tree, a project that came out of the initial experimentations in the first version of Cerebral.
- effector /2.8kStar/MIT/202010/ts
  - https://github.com/effector/effector
  - Effector is an effective multi-store state manager for Javascript apps (React/Vue/Node.js)
- store /187Star/MIT/202010
  - https://github.com/fabiospampinato/store
  - simple framework-agnostic modern state management library.
  - Thanks to usage of `Proxy` s you just have to wrap your state with store, 
  - mutate it and retrieve values from it just like if it was a regular object, 
  - and listen to changes via onChange or useStore.
- event-reduce /3Star/MIT/202010/ts/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/soxtoby/event-reduce
  - A small, opinionated, state management library based on reducing observable events into state
  - 吸收了redux和mobx的优点
  - event-reduce also has support for time-travelling debugging with the Redux DevTools.
  - What if my application is more complicated than a single counter?
    - I'd recommend putting your events in their own class
  - Chances are, your application is going to be even more complicated than even a list of counters grin. 
    - You're going to need more model classes, and you're going to want to scope events to particular child models. 
- pulse /225Star/MIT/202010/ts
  - https://github.com/pulse-framework/pulse
  - Global state and logic for reactive JavaScript applications. 
  - Supports frameworks like React, Vue, and React Native.
  - Replaces Redux, Vuex, and MobX for state; and for API requests, replaces Axios and fetch.
- suber /22Star/MIT/201703/js/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/oskarhane/suber
  - An eventbus/pubsub compatible with Redux middlewares
  - Works with popular side effects handling middlewares like redux-saga and redux-observable
- https://github.com/ForsakenHarmony/parket
  - A library to manage application state, heavily inspired by mobx-state-tree
  - This library uses Proxies and Symbols
# event pub/sub
- EventEmitter /3kStar/Unlicense/202001/js/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/Olical/EventEmitter
  - brings the power of events from platforms such as node.js to your browser
  - 对应npm包 https://www.npmjs.com/package/wolfy87-eventemitter
- PubSubJS /3.3kStar/MIT/202008/js
  - https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS
  - Dependency free topic-based publish/subscribe library written in JavaScript
  - PubSubJS has synchronisation decoupling, so topics are published asynchronously.
  - PubSubJS is designed to be used within a single process, and is not a good candidate for multi-process applications (like Node.js – Cluster with many sub-processes).
  - Use "constants" for topics and not string literals. PubSubJS uses strings as topics
- https://github.com/choojs/nanobus
  - We had the requirement for a * event to catch all calls, and figured we could improve the file size at the same time. 
  - This library is about 1/3rd the size of Node's version.
  - Are these emitters asynchronous? No.
- https://github.com/faye/faye
  - /4.3kStar/Apache2/202008/js
  - Faye is a publish-subscribe messaging system based on the Bayeux protocol. 
    - Bayeux协议目的是使用ajax实现客户端和服务器的双向通信
  - It provides message servers for Node.js and Ruby, and clients for use on the server and in all major web browsers.

- https://github.com/ganapativs/pure-cache
  - tiny in-memory JavaScript cache with near realtime cache expiry feature
- https://github.com/bpmn-io/scroll-tabs
  - ScrollTabs adds scroll buttons on the left and right side of the tabs container if not all tabs are visible. 
  - It also adds a mouse wheel listener on the container.
- https://github.com/elninotech/uppload
  - image uploader with 30+ plugins
- https://github.com/garronej/evt
  - EventEmitter's typesafe replacement
  - Why would someone pick EVT over RxJS:
    - RxJS introduces a lot of abstractions. It's a big jump from EventEmitter.
    - RxJS tends to be quite verbose.
    - With RxJS It is often needed to resort to custom type guards, the filter operator breaks the type inference.
    - It could be months before RxJS it eventually supports Deno.
    - No official guideline on how to integrate RxJS with React.
  - EVT is an attempt to address all these points while trying to remain as accessible as EventEmitter.

  - https://github.com/diegohaz/constate
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/github/diegohaz/constate/tree/master/examples/counter
  - 根据selector自动拆分成多个context，需要比较 创建多个context的消耗 和 使用useMemo的消耗
  - 使用selector自动创建的context是嵌套的，注意嵌套地狱
  - Write local state using React Hooks and lift it up to React Context only when needed with minimum effort.
  - 优点：相比于unstated-next，不需要自己创建Provider
  - 缺点：需要自己实现状态隔离

- react-tracked /MIT/645Star/202006
  - https://github.com/dai-shi/react-tracked
  - https://react-tracked.js.org/docs/comparison
  - Simple and fast global state with React Context. Eliminate unnecessary re-renders without hassle.
  - Technically, it uses Proxy underneath, and it tracks state usage in render so that if only used part of the state is changed, it will re-render.
  - React context by nature triggers propagation of component re-rendering if a value is changed.
    - To avoid this, this libraries use undocumented feature of `calculateChangedBits` . 
    - It then uses a subscription model to force update when a component needs to re-render.
