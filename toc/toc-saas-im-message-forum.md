    - We're definitely fans of re-use, and we do use existing modules, though in certain cases (DBAL and template engine), we roll our own for performance and workflow purposes.

  - [[FEATURE REQUEST] Proposal for Integration of FerretDB as an Alternative Database Backend for OpenIM _202404](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/issues/2250)
    - OpenIM currently relies on MongoDB for data storage. This proposal aims to integrate FerretDB, a MongoDB-compatible open-source database that avoids licensing constraints and offers more backend storage options, enhancing OpenIM's adaptability and performance.
  - [[Deployment] Could im change mongdb to another database？ _202505](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server/issues/2868)
    - we don’t have that plan at the moment.
    - This is typically not a small task; you’ll need to implement all of the database interfaces under `Open-IM-Server\pkg\common\storage\database`.

  - https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/realtime-client
    - Gitter uses Faye for it's realtime communications. 
    - It uses Faye as a fairly low-level messaging interface, and it can be quite difficult to implement an application correctly on top of it, especially when dealing idiosyncrasies(气质，习性) in the protocol
    - It uses Backbone Collections to represent Gitter data. The client will populate the collection and maintain the state of the collection to match the server-side representation of the state.

    - 前端数据库： IndexedDB 与 dexie.js（ORM）
    - 服务端用户鉴权： Clerk 为主，也支持 NextAuth
    - 服务端数据库： Postgres （Serverless 和 普通都支持）
    - ORM: Drizzle ORM
    - 服务端请求框架： tRPC
    - 感觉上面这一套，还能优化就是 Dexie.js 了，希望今年底之前能迁移到 pglite + electric-sql 的新方案，实现真正的 Local First 完全体
    - 现阶段用 pg 就是有一个全套的 auth + 服务端数据库，数据按用户维度保存。不用 pg 走前端db，消息按浏览器维度保存 (换个浏览器数据就没了) 未来个人知识库(文件上传)的功能只会做在 pg 版本上。因为社区不存在纯前端的生产级的 RAG 解决方案。
