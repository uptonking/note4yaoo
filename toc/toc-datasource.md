  - Each JSON line holds the content of one full Wikipedia article stripped of extra markdown and non-prose sections (references, etc.).
  - [Wikipedia Kaggle Dataset using Structured Contents Snapshot _202504](https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/blog/kaggle-dataset/)
    - Wikimedia Enterprise has released a beta dataset on Kaggle, featuring structured Wikipedia content in English and French. 
    - Designed with machine learning workflows in mind, this dataset simplifies access to clean, pre-parsed article data that’s immediately usable for modeling, benchmarking, alignment, fine-tuning, and exploratory analysis.
    - This release is powered by our Snapshot API’s Structured Contents beta, which outputs Wikimedia project data in a developer-friendly, machine-readable format. 
    - Instead of scraping or parsing raw article text, Kaggle users can work directly with well-structured JSON representations of Wikipedia content
    - The dataset upload, as of 15 April 2025, includes high-utility elements such as abstracts, short descriptions, infobox-style key-value data, image links, and clearly segmented article sections (excluding references and other non-prose elements which are only available via Snapshot API).
