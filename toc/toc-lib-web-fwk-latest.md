  - A tiny ~2kb library for building reactive interfaces in native JavaScript
  - Reactive Data => reactive
    - Reactive data objects have an $on and $off methods that allow us to observe mutations to their properties. 
  - Templates => html
    - Reactive expressions are callable functions, everything else is a static expression.
  - Watching data => watch
    - tracks any reactive data dependencies of that function, and then re-calls that function if any of the dependencies change

  - S.js is a small reactive programming library. 
  - It combines an automatic dependency graph with a synchronous execution engine. 

- https://github.com/emberjs/data /ts
  - a lightweight reactive data library for JavaScript applications that provides composable primitives for ordering query/mutation/peek flows, managing network and cache, and reducing data for presentation.
  - The core of Ember‚ÄçData is the Store, which coordinates interaction between your application, the Cache, and sources of data (such as your API or a local persistence layer). Optionally, the Store can be configured to hydrate the response data into rich presentation classes.
