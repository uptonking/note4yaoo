  - Learn how to build views in plain JavaScript in a way that is maintainable, performant, and fun. 
  - Writing JavaScript Views the Hard Way is inspired by such books as Learn C the Hard Way.
  - It is a pattern, not a library. This document explains how to write views in such a way as to avoid the spaghetti code problems that commonly occur when writing low-level imperative code.
  - uses direct imperative code, so there are no unnecessary operations performed. 
  - Code written with simple imperative views is portable to any framework.
  - it follows a props down, events up model that makes data sharing straight-forward.
  - it is functional(FP) in the sense that you're dealing with plain functions (no classes in sight) and without side-effects outside of the view's local state.
