# toc-lib-excel-airtable-notion-database

# guide

- ali-LowCodeEngine 目前仅支持生成React的前端代码
  - 开发成本固然低了，造出来的代码 **维护成本** 太高了
  - 这种东西，不会编程的人对他来说太复杂了，会编程的人来说太繁琐了。

- airtable-like 的产品的方向
  - 偏后端/api，类似strapi通过拖拽ui字段生成rest crud api，即headless cms
  - 偏前端/widget，类似airtable的通用表格组件，提供各种数据源的集成
  - 偏向automation

- 🆚️ table-builder vs page-builder/支持表格的页面编辑器
  - nocodb支持现有的外部数据源，而页面编辑器的数据一般都是手动输入到系统内部数据库
  - 页面编辑器的功能更杂糅，特色功能点和优势不明显

- lowcode数据库层实现细节
  - 参考strapi实现table+audit-log
  - 参考apitable/directus实现以oplog/delta为数据源的业务数据层
  - 基于oplog实现业务的案例: redux, event-store

- airtable-like产品的数据库设计
  - 一张用户自定义业务表对应db一张表
    - nocodb, grist, undb, eidos, nocobase
  - 一张用户自定义业务表对应db表的一行，🌹 此方案优点是方便基于纯内存实现
    - focalboard, apitable
  - 业务表通过view视图创建
    - locokit
  - ❓ 待确认
    - eidos

- 🤔 要点
  - 实现思路: 将editor作为一种类似table/kanban的数据视图来开发实现
  - 🆚️ notion database 的设计思路是先填写数据再设置类型，而不是大多数cms的先设置类型再填写数据
  - 动态修改数据类型或schema，可用eav或jsonb, 但大多方案是用户建表时同时在db建表

  - Rich Text Pages: Create documents, wikis, and notes using an intuitive editor, similar to Notion.
  - Customizable Databases: Organize information with structured data, custom fields and dynamic views (table, kanban, calendar).
  - Colanode includes a desktop app and a self-hosted server. You can connect to multiple servers with a single app, each containing one or more workspaces for different teams or projects. 
  - All changes you make are saved to a local SQLite database first and then synced to the server. A background process handles this synchronization so you can keep working even if your computer or the server goes offline. Data reads also happen locally, ensuring immediate access to any content you have permissions to view.
  - powered by Yjs - to allow real-time collaboration on entries like pages or database records.

  - https://github.com/mayneyao/eidos-wiki
  - https://wiki.eidos.space/
  - Eidos 是一个开源的、本地优先的 Web App ，完全运行在浏览器中，无需安装，也不依赖于任何服务器
  - 拥有和 Notion 类似的文档和表格，你可以理解为离线版的 Notion，所有数据都在本地
  - 依赖sqlite-wasm、glide-data-grid、lexical
  - 🆚️ Web app is deprecated, use desktop app instead.
    - The web app serves as a technology preview, incorporating several cutting-edge solutions such as OPFS and sqlite-wasm. However, due to browser environment limitations, the web version has some drawbacks and requires more recent browser versions.
    - The desktop version is built using Electron, primarily adapting the file system and SQLite. It utilizes native SQLite as its computation engine, offering better performance and more stable system permissions compared to the web version
    - The desktop version has built-in API services, while the web version does not.
  - [Roadmap | Eidos Wiki](https://wiki.eidos.space/roadmap)
    - 在 EA 测试后，主体功能稳定的情况下，会开放源码并且公测。我不是那么喜欢 build in public，预期和实现不一致容易消磨耐心
  - [Show HN: Eidos – Offline alternative to Notion | Hacker News _202406](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40746773)
    - built based on sqlite-wasm and runs entirely in the browser
    - A block-styled document editor and an Airtable-like table, built on top of SQLite, where each table is a real SQLite table.
    - A powerful extension system inspired by Figma plugin and Cloudflare worker. You can write scripts in TypeScript directly in the browser. It is easy to manipulate data in docs, tables, and the file system. It also supports API.
    - Eidos deeply integrated with LLM. You can translate, summarize, talk to your data
    - 🛢️ A key idea of Eidos is to make each table a real SQLite table, so users can view and modify it through other software or visualize it with tools like Metabase
    - You can make some adjustments in the settings to store data in a local folder. Then, use iCloud, Git, or your preferred service to back up your data. Just like the web version of VSCode, it can handle local files. The web is just an app and doesn't hold any data.
    - I carefully designed the architecture, which is very flexible. The "backend" is currently running on web worker & service worker. It should be possible to deploy it to a web-standard runtime environment for self-hosting. P2P synchronization based on CRDT is on the roadmap.
  - https://discord.com/channels/1153437530952323186/1153437531883446277/1285260552872132619
    - Where can I read more about the data structure? Is everything a block (like in Remnote, and the new upcoming Logseq db)?
    - 👷202409: Each space contains a files directory to store static resources such as images, PDFs, audio, video, etc. All other data is stored in the `db.sqlite3` file. 
    - All documents are stored in `eidos__docs`. Each table is an actual database table and not a view of a collection of blocks
    - Each document follows a standard lexical data structure, stored in JSON format in the `content` field, and includes a readable markdown version stored in the `markdown` field. 
    - SQLite contains all the data, making it convenient for portability, storage, computation, and retrieval. Based on this design, both documents and tables can be queried and retrieved even without using the Eidos app.
    - The Eidos table is a lightweight wrapper for SQLite table, allowing it to handle large amounts of data, which Notion/Obsidian/Logseq cannot achieve. On my M2 MacBook Pro, a table with 1 million records runs
    - 🤔 In Eidos it seems there is a hard separation between tables and nodes/blocks. Personally I'm looking for a PKMS, and the "everything is a x" concept is important to me.
    - Eidos is not a tool specifically designed for PKM. Tables and documents are separated, but they can query each other through SQL because they are in the same sqlite database
    - The biggest difference is whether you put the data in a table or a document. I don't think it's a good idea to put structured data in a document because the query will not work when you leave these apps.
    - Word and Excel are distinct tools, and different types of data should have separate containers. I don't want to mix them up just to fit the concept of 'everything is x'. When you have a lot of CSV/Excel files, you definitely don't want to create a markdown document for every row.
    - Actually, my initial goal was to build an offline Airtable/Notion database. I would focus more on the tables.

- obsidian dataview /5.8kStar/MIT/202312/ts
  - https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview
  - https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/
  - A high-performance data index and query language over Markdown files, for obsidian
  - Treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from. 
  - Provides a JavaScript API and pipeline-based query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages.
  - **Dataview generates data from your vault by pulling information from Markdown frontmatter and Inline fields**.
  - Markdown frontmatter is arbitrary YAML enclosed by `---` at the top of a markdown document which can store metadata about that document.
  - Inline fields are a Dataview feature which allow you to write metadata directly inline in your markdown document via `Key:: Value` syntax.

  - https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases
    - Obsidian is not open source software and this repo DOES NOT contain the source code of Obsidian. 
    - However, if you wish to contribute to Obsidian, you can easily do so with our extensive plugin system.
  - https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore /MIT
    - Datacore is a work-in-progress re-imagining of Dataview with a focus on 2-10x better query and rendering performance, as well as fully interactible views.
    - Datacore is fundamentally the same thing as dataview - an index over Markdown files that supports live-updating views and metadata. 
    - However, Datacore focuses on substantial index changes for performance, as well as a new sleek UI which completely replaces traditional Dataview queries. 
    - Datacore supports all query operations that Dataview does, with some extra functionality.
    - WYSIWYG Views: Datacore queries now use a responsive table view and can be manipulated with a table editor much more akin to what you would see in places like Notion and Airtable.
    - Live Editing: Values inside of table views can now be edited; task views include more nuanced rendering of metadata like due date and more operations for manipulating tasks directly.
