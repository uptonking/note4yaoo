# guide
- tips
  - 产品开发前进行技术选型时要多分析使用场景，ssr和csr的技术栈本身就是不同的，jsx只是view层，服务端要考虑routing/cache/streaming/i18n
  - 一般ssr方案都会提供自己的router, nextjs将file-based-routing作为卖点
  - 没必要寻找前后端通用的router，前端、后端框架都有自己的，routing常和prefetch耦合
  - 有的方案支持首屏ssr，之后spa，基于不同的render mode

  - The joyful site generator
  - îles — french word for "islands". 
  - Partial Hydration - zero JS by default, hydrates the interactive bits
  - Multi-Framework - vue, preact, svelte, solid
  - Fast - instant reloading powered by Vite
  - Routing - automatically configured from files
  - https://iles-docs.netlify.app/faqs
    - With iles the page is pre-rendered just like in server-side rendering, but JS is automatically added for the interactive bits, more optimal than hydrating the entire page.
    - VitePress has an MPA mode to strip away all JS. In iles that happens automatically if you don't use hydration directives.
  - [question: purpose of this library _202110](https://github.com/ElMassimo/iles/issues/5)
    - The main difference is that îles provides great support partial hydration, so you can ship JS only for the interactive parts of the page by simply adding `client:` directives. In Vitepress partial hydration is still a manual process.
    - It's easier to build blogs in îles than in Vitepress, and if you need a SPA you would go with Vitepress.

  - Build hybrid SSG and SSR realtime SPA/MPA with Typescript
  - ts-liveview supports JSX but it doesn't rely on Virtual DOM. Instead, precise DOM operations are derived from application-specific event handlers, and sent to the browser client(s) for realtime UI updates.
  - Support hybrid rendering mode: pre-rendering, Request-time server-rendering with HTML streaming
  - Support url-based routing architectures
  - Enable interactive UI with minimal amount of javascript to be downloaded
  - Support to develop with JSX, AST, or html template
  - Lightweight WebSocket-based protocols 
  - Built-in locale support (language and timezone)
  - Inspired from Phoenix LiveView, htmx

  - https://www.liveviewjs.com/docs/overview/introduction
  - LiveViewJS is an open-source framework for "LiveView"-based, full-stack applications in NodeJS and Deno.
  - The LiveView pattern, as popularized in Elixir’s Phoenix framework, shifts your UI’s state management, event handling to the server, calculating minimal diffs to drive updates in your HTML over WebSockets.
  - a LiveView is a server-rendered HTML page that, when loaded, connects back to the server via a persistent web socket. As the user interacts with the LiveView, the client to sends user events (click, keys, etc) via the websocket back to the server and the server responds with diffs to the HTML page in return.
  - LiveViewJS is a protocol compliant, implementation of Phoenix LiveView but written in Typescript and runs on NodeJS and Deno. We want to bring the magic and productivity of LiveView to the NodeJS and Deno ecosystems

  - [Nano JSX, Laravel, InertiaJS with SSR _202112](https://github.com/nanojsx/nano/discussions/75)

- https://github.com/inertiajs/inertia /MIT/202311/ts
  - https://inertiajs.com/
  - Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers. 
  - Inertia works great with any backend framework, but it's fine-tuned for Laravel.
  - Inertia isn't a framework, nor is it a replacement for your existing server-side or client-side frameworks. Rather, it's designed to work with them
  - https://discord.com/channels/592327939920494592/758259460920573992/1204350428708339773
    - Inertia SSR is an addition, not a conversion/replacement
  - [How it works - Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/how-it-works)
    - At its core, Inertia is essentially a client-side routing library. It allows you to make page visits without forcing a full page reload. 
    - This is done using the `<Link>` component, a light-weight wrapper around a normal anchor link. 
    - When you click an Inertia link, Inertia intercepts the click and makes the visit via XHR instead. 
    - You can even make these visits programmatically in JavaScript using `router.visit()`.
    - When Inertia makes an XHR visit, the server detects that it's an Inertia visit and, instead of returning a full HTML response, it returns a JSON response with the JavaScript page component name and data (props). 
  - [Server-side rendering (SSR) - Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/server-side-rendering)
    - Server-side rendering pre-renders your JavaScript pages on the server, allowing your visitors to receive fully rendered HTML

- https://github.com/pmb0/express-tsx-views /MIT/202110/ts/inactive
  - Server-side JSX/TSX rendering for your express or NestJS application
  - With this template engine, TSX files can be rendered server-side by your Express application. 
  - Unlike other JSX express renderers, this one does not rely on JSX files being transpiled by `babel` at runtime. Instead, TSX files are processed once by the `tsc` compiler.
  - For this to work, the templates are imported dynamically during rendering.

  - this component can be rendered to html with `ReactDOM.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

- https://github.com/reactjs/express-react-views /201810/js
  - an Express view engine which renders React components on server.
  - It renders static markup and does not support mounting those views on the client.
  - This is intended to be used as a replacement for existing server-side view solutions, like jade, ejs, or handlebars.

  - Frugal is a hybrid, dynamic and static site generator that aims to minimize the amount of JavaScript served, thanks to partial hydration
  - Static pages rendered at build time: by default Frugal produces static html.
  - Server side pages render at request time
  - Bring your own framework: Frugal works with any UI framework able to compile to html
  - Manual partial hydration for interactive island in pages if you use Preact
  - Incremental build: if both data and code did not change, the page is not rebuilt

  - next-boost adds a cache layer to your SSR (Server-Side Rendering) applications. 
  - It was built originally for Next.js and should work with any node.js `http.Server` based application.
  - achieves great performance by rendering webpages on `worker_threads` while serving the cached on the main thread.
  - If you are familiar with Next.js, next-boost can be considered as an implementation of Incremental Static Regeneration which works with getServerSideProps. And it's not meant to be used with getStaticProps, in which Next.js will do the cache for you.

  - Uber’s open source universal web framework, represents the fusion of the client and the server. 
  - It's geared for server-side rendering out of the box, and its plugin-driven architecture allows for complex frontend and backend logic to be encapsulated in a single plugin
  - Because Fusion.js applications are universal, which means that apps have a single entry point, all code from React components to middlewares in Fusion.js plugins by default runs on both the server and browser.

  - An API to render a page inside a real Chromium (with JavaScript enabled) and send back the raw HTML
  - This project was heavily inspired by GoogleChrome/rendertron.
  - It was based on `puppeteer-core` but we switched to `Playwright`.
  - This project is directly written for and consumed by Algolia Crawler.
  - Renderscript has everything abstracted to render a page and login to website with minimal configuration required.

- https://github.com/prerender/prerender
  - Prerender is a node server that uses Headless Chrome to render HTML, screenshots, PDFs, and HAR files out of any web page. 
  - The Prerender server listens for an http request, takes the URL and loads it in Headless Chrome, waits for the page to finish loading by waiting for the network to be idle, and then returns your content.
  - The Prerender server can be used in conjunction with our Prerender.io middleware in order to serve the prerendered HTML of your js website to search engines (Google, Bing, etc) and social networks (Facebook, Twitter, etc) for SEO.
  - Prerender differs from Google Puppeteer in that Prerender is a web server that takes in URLs and loads them in parallel in a new tab in Headless Chrome. 
    - Puppeteer is an API for interacting with Chrome, but you still have to write that interaction yourself. 
    - With Prerender, you don't have to write any code to launch Chrome, load pages, wait for the page to load, or pull the content off of the page. 
    - The Prerender server handles all of that for you so you can focus on more important things!
  - Prerender solves SEO by serving prerendered HTML to Google and other search engines. It's easy:
    - Just install the appropriate middleware for your app (or check out the source code and build your own)
    - Make sure search engines have a way of discovering your pages (e.g. `sitemap.xml` and links from other parts of your site or from around the web)

  - Zero configuration is the main feature. 
  - **Works out-of-the-box with create-react-app** - no code-changes required.
  - Does not depend on React. The name is inspired by react-snapshot but works with any technology (e.g., Vue).
  - [Behind the scenes](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap/blob/master/doc/behind-the-scenes.md)
