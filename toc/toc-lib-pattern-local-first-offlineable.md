  - Build Offline-First Apps for Web and React Native
  - Persistent Redux store for Reasonaboutable Offline-First applications, with first-class support for optimistic UI. 
  - Use with React, React Native, or as standalone state container for any web app.
  - 🤔 没必要执着于寻找已有的offline方案，使用 persist + crdt 也可以实现协作

- local-first /191Star/202104/js/inactive
  - https://github.com/jaredly/local-first
  - This aims to eventually be a fully-featured solution for managing, syncing, and storing application data, in a way that works offline, and collaboratively.
  - Currently implemented
    - a hybrid logical clock (blog post, code)
    - a nested object CRDT (code)
    - a rich-text CRDT (code, example integration with quill, visualization of the data structure)

- tuple-database /200Star/NALic/202208/ts
  - https://github.com/ccorcos/tuple-database
  - The architecture of this database draws inspiration from a bunch of different places (although, primarily from FoundationDb).
  - 👉🏻 The local-first, "end-user database" database.
    - When users own all of their data on their devices, it's a natural way of sharding a database and scaling up a platform.
    - As a constraint, this means that I'm interested in building an embedded database, like SQLite or LevelDb, that runs in process and is intended to be single tenant. 
  - 👉🏻 All queries are reactive.
    - Polished applications these days require realtime reactivity.
    - And it's not just for collaboration — reactivity necessary when a user has multiple windows or tabs showing the same data.
    - Many systems have record-level or table-level reactivity, but I want all queries to be reactive. I'm tired of having to engineer custom solutions on top of databases with brittle logic where a developer might forget to emit an update event.
  - 👉🏻 ✨ Schemaless — schemas are enforced by the application, not the database.
    - It took me some time to realize the the value of maintaining schemas in the application rather than the database. 
    - a schemaless database should be flexible enough to accept incoming data and allow the application to resolve conflicts or schema issues.
    - I want to build apps like Notion and Airtable where end-users define their own schemas. 
  - 👉🏻 Asynchronous or Synchronous, Persisted or In-Memory Storage
    - I want to be able to persist data. And most persistence layers are asynchronous: LevelDb or even a cloud database. But even when persistence is synchronous, like SQLite, you might have to asynchronously cross a process boundary, such as an Electron window interacting with a database on the main process.
    - I want to use a synchronous in-memory database for frontend state management 
    - Works with synchronous and asynchronous storage including SQLite or LevelDb.
  - Transactional read/writes written in TypeScript.
  - Directly read/write indexes with the ability to index graph/relational queries.
  - Suitable for frontend state management.
- https://github.com/ccorcos/game-counter
  - A simple application for keeping score in games. For example, golf or Settlers of Catan.
  - External effects interface through services defined on the Environment.
  - TupleDatabase as a UI state management system.

- tinybase /1.3kStar/MIT/202209/ts/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/tinyplex/tinybase
  - https://tinybase.org/
  - A tiny, reactive JavaScript library for structured state and tabular data.
  - Familiar concepts of tables, rows, and cells, and schematization to model your data domain.
  - Flexibly reactive to reconciled updates, so you only spend cycles on the data that changes.
  - Indexing, metrics, relationships - and even an undo stack for your app state!
  - Easily sync your data to local or remote storage, and use idiomatic bindings to your React UI.
  - Powerful query engine to select, join, filter, group, sort and paginate data - reactively.

- https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu
  - React Hooks library for local-first software with end-to-end encrypted backup and sync using SQLite and CRDT
  - writing local-first software has been challenging because of the lack of libraries and design patterns. I personally failed several times, and that's why I created Evolu.
  - Evolu architecture is almost a clone of James Long CRDT for mortals. Rewritten and improved,

- https://github.com/logux/client
  - https://logux.io/
  - Logux is a new way to connect client and server. 
  - Instead of sending HTTP requests (e.g., AJAX and GraphQL) it synchronizes log of operations between client, server, and other clients.
  - Logux and WebSocket client/server framework to make:
    - Logux has features inspired by CRDT to resolve edit conflicts between users. Real-time updates to prevent conflicts
    - Logux combines WebSocket with modern reactive client architecture. It synchronizes Redux actions between clients and servers, and keeps the same order of actions.
    - Offline-first for the next billion users or New York City Subway. Logux saves Redux actions to IndexedDB and has a lot of features to merge changes from different users.
    - Compatible with modern stack: Redux, Vuex and pure JS API, works with any back-end language and any database.

- https://github.com/nornagon/autowiki
  - Autowiki is a tool for creating networked documents.
  - Autowiki is a local-first app: you own all the data you put into it, and your data never leaves your own machine unless you want it to.
  - Autowiki uses automerge under the hood to resolve edit conflicts automatically.

- https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie
  - Hoodie lets you build apps without thinking about the backend and makes sure that they work great independent of connectivity.

- https://github.com/local-first-web/state
  - A Redux-based state container for local-first software, offering seamless synchronization using Automerge CRDTs. (Formerly known as fish Cevitxe).
  - @localfirst/state is an automatically replicated Redux store that gives your app offline capabilities and secure peer-to-peer synchronization superpowers.

- rxdb /17.6kStar/Apache2/202206/ts
  - https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb
  - https://rxdb.info/
  - 依赖rxjs7
  - A fast, offline-first, reactive database for JavaScript Applications
  - a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps and NodeJs. 
  - 👉🏻 RxDB is not a self contained database. 
    - It is a wrapper around another database that implements the `RxStorage` interface. 
    - At the moment you can either use `PouchDB` or `Dexie.js` or `LokiJS` as underlaying storage. 
    - Each of them respectively has it's own adapters that can be swapped out, depending on your needs. 
    - For example you can use and IndexedDB based storage in the browser, and an SQLite storage in your hybrid app

  - A local-first and universal knowledge graph, personal search engine, and workspace for your life.

- https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-desktop

  - The map editor is based on iDEditor. 
  - The app is built with Electron.
