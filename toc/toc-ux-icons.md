- ## “How to make complex icons with only CSS”. Don’t do this.
- https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/643803332117704704
  - Use #SVG. It was *made* for this kind of stuff.
- If someone wants to show off skills they should try hand-coding SVG path data
- SVG icons are accessible and semantic. CSS icons are FAKE icons. Also, the epic icon fonts vs SVG comparison guide
- use SVG instead of icon fonts whenever possible.
- CSS only icons are awful, iconographers have a job for a reason.
  - Iconography is such a specific art form with considerable effort taken to convey meaning, brand personality and functionality.
- the only advantage I can see is you can mutate glyphs without js—but those mutations are super specific so it's kinda moot

- ## Seriously, Don’t Use Icon Fonts
- https://cloudfour.com/thinks/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/
- Screen Readers Actually Read That Stuff
  - Most assistive devices will read aloud text inserted via CSS, and many of the Unicode characters icon fonts depend on are no exception. 
  - Best-case scenario, your “favorite” icon gets read aloud as “black favorite star.” 
  - Worse-case scenario, it’s read as “unpronounceable” or skipped entirely.
- They’re a Nightmare if You’re Dyslexic(诵读困难的)
- They Encroach on Emoji Turf(unicode冲突)
- They Fail Poorly and Often(下载失败时浏览器可能显示乱码)
- They Never Looked Right
  - The way browsers hint fonts to optimize legibility was never a good fit for our custom iconography
  - Multicolor icons are even worse.
  - 还要考虑不同浏览器渲染字体所产生的不一致
- There’s Already a Better Way
  - svg is a vector image format with optional support for CSS
- 不要墨守陈规，盲目模仿

  - Moving Away From Font Icons
      - https://blog.ionicframework.com/announcing-ionicons-v4/
      - When we originally released Ionicons, we went the route of making an icon font. At the time, this made a lot of sense: 
          - Icon fonts are vector-based, 
          - scalable to any physical size without pixelation, 
          - able to be styled with CSS,  
          - come from a single resource (which means fewer HTTP requests).
      - they also have a cost that can flip their advantage into a disadvantage: all of the icons are bundled in one file. And in previous versions of Ionicons, we were packing nearly 700 icons into one large file!
          - Large font files have a negative impact on a webpage or app’s Time to First Paint, which makes for a subpar user experience and has been known to lower PWA Lighthouse scores. 
          - On top of that, adding any custom icons to a font icon is far from easy.
      - All of the benefits of font icons (vector-based and styling with CSS) can be achieved just as easily with SVGs, but without all the baggage.
# icons-utils
