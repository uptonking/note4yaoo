  - https://parseplatform.org/
  - https://docs.parseplatform.org/parse-server/guide/
  - https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/wiki
  - Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any infrastructure that can run Node.js. 
  - ‰æùËµñexpress„ÄÅgraphql„ÄÅmongodb„ÄÅpg-promise„ÄÅredis
  - Parse Server works with the Express web application framework. It can be added to existing web applications, or run by itself.
  - In addition to the traditional REST API, Parse Server automatically generates a GraphQL API based on your current application schema. 
  - Parse Server uses MongoDB or PostgreSQL as a database.
    - üçÉ The preferred database is MongoDB but Postgres is a great option if you‚Äôre starting a new project and you expect to have a stable Schema.
    - When using MongoDB with your Parse app, you need to manage your indexes yourself. You will also need to size up your database as your data grows.
    - In order to allow for better scaling of your data layer, it is possible to direct queries to a MongoDB secondary for read operations.
    - üêò When using Postgres with your Parse app, you need to manage your indexes yourself.

  - Infraless Database over any s3 storage API.
  - [mps3 - Offline-first DB over S3-compatible storage](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/mps3-vendor-examples)
  - https://twitter.com/tomlarkworthy/status/1688132733246033920
    - I've been noodling with the concept of a vendorless BaaS by using an s3-compatible API as the backend. 
    - By hacking object versioning you get serialisability and atomic bulk updates. 
    - Its a real DB! Here it's using a local minio instance. Might try backblaze next.
    - Oh I have to expose the ETag header in the CORS config thats improved things to 400ms sometimes but I still have too many preflight requests
    - The sync protocol was designed using object versioning so that the logical names intuitively map to storage names, but then I realised R2, my favourite s3-like doesn't do versions. So now I had to redo it with timestamped suffixes. Total redesign with tricky clock skew defenses

    - Have you thought about adding Operational Transform or CRDT primitives to your offering?
    - Currently any additional data transformation is left to the developers to extend via event hooks or custom client side handling.
    - I've worked with CRDT in the past (yjs), but it may not be very useful in PocketBase considering that the application was designed to run on a single server and db writes are practically queued (you can have only one sqlite writer at a time)

  - This project is aimed at providing a series of handy packages for the development of a typical CRUD web application.
  - The packages are work around a kind of schema written in JSON for database table.

  - https://insforge.dev/
  - the Agent-Native Supabase Alternative. 
  - We are building the features of Supabase in an AI-native way, enabling AI agents to build and manage full-stack applications autonomously.
  - [I built a backend that agents can understand and control through MCP : r/CLine _202510](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1nz29qb/i_built_a_backend_that_agents_can_understand_and/)
    - The coding agent didn‚Äôt really understand my backend. It didn‚Äôt know my database schema, which functions existed, or how different parts were wired together. To avoid hallucinations, I had to keep repeating the same context manually. 
    - That‚Äôs why I built InsForge, a backend as a service designed for AI coding. It follows many of the same architectural ideas as Supabase, but is customized for agent driven workflows. Through MCP, agents get structured backend context and can interact with real backend tools directly.

# ha/high-availability
- https://github.com/dashersw/cote /MIT/202406/js
  - http://cote.js.org/
  - A Node.js library for building zero-configuration microservices.
  - cote lets you write zero-configuration microservices in Node.js without nginx, haproxy, redis, rabbitmq or anything else. 
  - Zero-configuration: No IP addresses, no ports, no routing to configure
  - Decentralized: No fixed parts, no "manager" nodes, no single point of failure
  - Scalable: Horizontally scale to any number of machines
  - Typically, in a microservices system, the application is broken into smaller chunks that communicate with each other.
  - It replaces queue protocols and service registry software by clever use of IP broadcast/IP multicast systems. cote needs an environment that allows the use of IP broadcast or multicast, in order to scale beyond a single machine.
