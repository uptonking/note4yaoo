- https://github.com/microsoft/redux-dynamic-modules /202003/ts/inactive
  - aims to make Redux Reducers and middleware easy to modular-ize and add/remove dynamically.
  - In large Javascript applications, it is often desired to perform some kind of code-splitting, so that the initial script size is small. 
  - However, in Redux, you are required to define your reducers and middleware up-front; 
  - there is no good way to dynamically add/remove these constructs at runtime.
  - designed to make dynamically loading these constructs easier
# react-context-redux

  - It uses the React Context API instead of Redux for managing state under the hood.
  - Depends on use-context-selector to prevent unnecessary rerenders.
  - createSlice(): This is exported directly from @reduxjs/toolkit

- https://github.com/redux-orm/redux-orm /202104/js/inactive
  - https://redux-orm.github.io/redux-orm/
  - simple and immutable ORM to manage relational data in your Redux store.
  - Redux-ORM deals with related data, structured similar to a relational database. The database in this case is a simple JavaScript object database.
  - For simple apps, writing reducers by hand is alright, but when the number of object types you have increases and you need to maintain relations between them, things get hairy. 
    - ImmutableJS goes a long way to reduce complexity in your reducers, but Redux-ORM is specialized for relational data.
  - [Call for Maintainer and Contributors](https://github.com/redux-orm/redux-orm/issues/123)
    - I've been moving away from redux to things like react-query and lost traction on redux-orm

- redux-database /18Star/MIT/202005/ts/NoDeps/inactive
  - https://github.com/nerdgeschoss/redux-database
  - https://nerdgeschoss.github.io/redux-database
  - Simple reducer based in-memory database with strong typings and immutable documents, with plugins for redux and react.
  - Client side data normalization is hard. This library helps you to organize your state in a relational way, with queries and joins as you would expect from an SQL based database. 
  - There is a storage adaper for redux or you can use it as a standalone library (redux-database has no dependencies!).

- https://github.com/msolvaag/redux-db /201902/ts/inactive
  - provides a normalized redux store and easy object management.
  - Having a normalized state is a good strategy if your data is nested in different ways. 
- https://github.com/cape-io/redux-graph /js/inactive
  - Redux Graph Database
  - basic graph database with entity and triple storage

- https://github.com/lscheibel/redux-yjs-bindings
  - https://lscheibel.github.io/redux-yjs-bindings/
  - Use Yjs to sync your Redux store with other peers!
  - small (roughly 1kB) bridge to connect Redux with a Yjs, allows you to use the synchronization features of Yjs with the data management capabilities of Redux. 
  - It works with any Redux store, whether you use Redux Toolkit or not, and even supports initial values. 
  - Values that are transmitted over the network can be any JSON serializable value, from primitives to deeply nested object structures.
  - Special thanks to Joseph Miles whose zustand-middleware-yjs library was an inspiration.
  - https://github.com/joebobmiles/zustand-middleware-yjs
    - Zustand middleware that enables sharing of state between clients via Yjs.
    - One of the difficult things about using Yjs is that it's not easily integrated with modern state management libraries in React. 
    - This middleware for Zustand solves that problem by allowing a Zustand store to be turned into a CRDT, with the store's state replicated to all peers.
    - This differs from the other Yjs and Zustand solution, `zustand-yjs` by allowing any Zustand store be turned into a CRDT. This contrasts with `zustand-yjs`'s solution, which uses a Zustand store to collect shared types and access them through special hooks.

- https://github.com/iamogbz/react-ducks
  - Implement ducks in React following the redux pattern but using React Context.
  - Uses `immer` to wrap reducers when creating, ensuring atomic state mutations.

- https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-mock-store
  - A mock store for testing Redux async action creators and middleware. T
  - this library is designed to test the action-related logic, not the reducer-related one. 
  - In other words, it does not update the Redux store.

- https://github.com/redux-form/redux-form
  - the general consensus of the community is that you should not put your form state in Redux.
  - The author of Redux Form took all of the lessons he learned about form use cases from maintaining Redux Form and built React Final Form
  - The only good reason, in the author's view, to use Redux Form is if you need really tight coupling of your form data with Redux
  - If you don't have that requirement, use React Final Form.
