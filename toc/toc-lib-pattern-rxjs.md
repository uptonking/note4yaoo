    - At the moment you can either use `PouchDB` or `Dexie.js` or `LokiJS` as underlaying storage. 
    - Each of them respectively has it's own adapters that can be swapped out, depending on your needs. 
    - For example you can use and IndexedDB based storage in the browser, and an SQLite storage in your hybrid app

# extensions
- https://github.com/cartant/rxjs-spy
  - A debugging library for RxJS
  - The engineers at Slack have adopted rxjs-spy
  - rxjs-spy introduces a tag operator that can be used to identify observables. It attaches a string tag to an observable
  - it performs no additional processing and does not alter the observable's behaviour or value in any way.
  - The API's methods are tag-based and tags can be matched using explicit literals, regular expressions or function predicates. 
  - rxjs-spy exposes a module API intended to be called from code and a console API - via the spy global

- https://github.com/staltz/toy-rx
  - A tiny implementation of RxJS that actually works, for learning.
  - I made this so people can look into the implementation of a simple RxJS and feel like they can actually understand it.
  - It's missing a ton of stuff that the official RxJS covers, such as:
    - Subscribe supports partial Observer objects
- https://github.com/WangYuLue/simple-rxjs
  - 200行代码理解rxjs的核心概念

  - agent-based reactive programming library for typescript
  - CONNECTIVE is a thin layer on top of RxJS, so it provides all the toolset of rxjs by proxy. 
  - However, while RxJS's API is better suited for short-lived and small flows, CONNECTIVE adds tools better suiting long-living and large/complex flows.
