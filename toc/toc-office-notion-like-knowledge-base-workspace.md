  - https://wiki.dendron.so/
  - /AGPL
  - local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool built on top of VSCode. 
  - Dendron finds the usable center between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a canonical hierarchy for every note. 
  - We do this through our hierarchal first approach to note taking that relies on the combination of hierarchies, schemas, and path based lookups.
  - [A Hierarchy First Approach to Note Taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)
    - My primary use for notes is as a cache. Think Redis, but for humans.
    - If I spent more than 5 minutes figuring something out, those are five minutes I never want to spend again figuring out the same problem.
    - But this is difficult to do in practice.
    - My solution is something I call hierarchical note taking.
