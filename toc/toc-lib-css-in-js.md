- treat /975Star/MIT/202009
  - https://github.com/seek-oss/treat
  - Themeable, statically extracted CSS‑in‑JS with near‑zero runtime.
  - 类似sass的预编译，不能在runtime生成新样式
  - 很可能针对同一样式名生成以不同主题作为前缀的多个类，若如此，则样式爆炸
    - 可考虑在生产环境生成atomic css，而不是原有类名
- astroturf /1.8kStar/MIT/202004
  - https://github.com/4Catalyzer/astroturf
  - lets you write CSS in your JavaScript files without adding any runtime layer
  - 生成css，需要单独考虑css文件，额外使用autoprefix插件
- glaze /375Star/MIT/202006
  - https://github.com/kripod/glaze
  - 缺点是部分样式是动态生成的
  - 支持treat file形式的静态样式，也支持在sx方法中书写带theme约束的样式值，但这部分样式会动态生成
  - 要使用glaze的ThemeProvider传入theme，不能使用react-treat的TreatProvider传入theme
  - Glaze, the theme-ui API with almost zero runtime based on treat
  - This project was born to combine the best of its predecessors into a single solution
    - Near-zero runtime, made possible by treat: Theming support, Static style extraction
    - Utility-first CSS, as implemented by Tailwind CSS: no duplicated rules
    - Constraint-based layouts, popularized by Theme UI
  - [Production ready? no. 主程已转向研发otion](https://github.com/kripod/glaze/issues/37)
    - The otion project will provide the foundation to build glaze upon. Eventually, it will replace treat for static style management.
- https://github.com/WalltoWall/calico
  - Calico is a customizable styling library that maps React props to statically generated class names.
  - 缺点是组件必须使用提供的Box组件创建
  - 优点是支持预先编译出所有css，使用原子类的形式，
    - 但生成的样式名超级多，适合大规模应用，不适合小应用
  - 基于treat和react-treat，所有主题的样式均可静态提取
  - 通过styles属性直接书写theme对象中的属性值，通过类似`Button.treat.js`的treat file添加一次性的样式
  - Very light runtime made possible by the treat library.
    - Static style extraction with full type safety.
    - Dynamic styles via swapping classNames.
  - Atomic CSS as inspired by libraries like Tailwind CSS
    - Encourages reusability with a finite set of generated classNames.
  - Developer-centric as inspired by styled-system and theme-ui.
    - Define responsive styles via arrays.
    - Namespaced styles to ease type-extensibility.
    - One-off styles can be defined in .treat files with additional responsive helpers added onto your theme.
- css-zero /179Star/MIT/201912
  - https://github.com/CraigCav/css-zero
  - All of the benefits of writing CSS-in-JS, but with zero runtime code
  - Works without JavaScript, as styles are extracted at build-time.
  - Generates optimized, atomic CSS with no duplicated style rules
  - Theme support via CSS variables, allowing the cost of theming to be proportional to the size of the color palette
  - This repo was heavily inspired by linaria. The biggest behavioral difference is that linaria doesn't generate atomic CSS.
  - 参考facebook的stylex
- stylemug /51Star/MIT/202006/js
  - https://github.com/matvp91/stylemug
  - A fast css-in-js library that extracts atomic CSS rules to a .css file.

  - https://github.com/lttb/reshadow
  - Combine the css-in-js and css-modules approaches or choose which fits you better
