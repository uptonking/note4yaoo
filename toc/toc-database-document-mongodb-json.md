- minimongo /1kStar/LGPLv3/202207/ts
  - https://github.com/mWater/minimongo
  - A client-side MongoDB implementation which supports basic queries, including some geospatial ones.
  - It is either IndexedDb backed (IndexedDb), WebSQL backed (WebSQLDb), Local storage backed (LocalStorageDb) or in memory only (MemoryDb).
  - Uses code from Meteor.js minimongo package, reworked to support more geospatial queries 

- nedb /13.1kStar/MIT/201602/js
  - https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb
  - Embedded persistent or in memory database for Node.js, nw.js, Electron and browsers, 100% JavaScript, no binary dependency. 
  - API is a subset of MongoDB's and it's plenty fast.
  - You can use NeDB as an in-memory only datastore or as a persistent datastore. 
  - One datastore is the equivalent of a MongoDB collection
  - Under the hood, NeDB's persistence uses an append-only format, meaning that all updates and deletes actually result in lines added at the end of the datafile, for performance reasons.
  - If you specify a filename, the database will be persistent, and automatically select the best storage method available (IndexedDB, WebSQL or localStorage) depending on the browser.
  - [Is this still maintained?](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb/issues/492)

# tree-like/nested
- https://github.com/TheGuardianWolf/treepack
  - Pack tree nodes into a flat object and unpack them again!
  - The original use case is to allow path based trees (such as the one used by Slate) to be stored in NoSQL based storage and be able to update them partially without sending the full tree.
  - Limitations
    - It is assumed that you have children of each node in a single array object
    - Self referencing objects at any point in the tree are not supported
    - An id field is required to perform better change detection (using idKey option).

- https://github.com/Voronenko/Storing_TreeView_Structures_WithMongoDB

  - using five typical approaches plus one combination of operating with hierarchy data on example of the MongoDB database.
