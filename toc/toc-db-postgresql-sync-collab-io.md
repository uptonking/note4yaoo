  - Bemi automatically tracks database changes ensuring 100% reliability and a comprehensive understanding of every change. 
  - It does it by connecting PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and implementing Change Data Capture (CDC) data pattern. 
  - Designed with simplicity and non-invasiveness in mind, Bemi operates in the background and doesn't require any alterations to your existing database tables
  - Time travel querying and ability to easily filter changes
  - Optional application-specific context by using ORM packages
  - Bemi consists of three main parts:
    - Debezium, a very flexible tool for implementing Change Data Capture that is written in Java
    - NATS JetStream, a cloud-native messaging system written in Go.
    - Bemi Worker, a process responsible for stitching data change with app context sent via our open-source ORM packages and storing data changes.

  - Postgres extension for conflict-free distributed programming utilities written in Rust

  - a tool that automates running `pg_dump | pg_restore` between two running Postgres servers. 
  - To make a copy of a database to another server as quickly as possible, one would like to use the parallel options of `pg_dump` and still be able to stream the data to as many `pg_restore` jobs.
