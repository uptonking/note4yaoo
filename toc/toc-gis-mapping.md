  - Lightweight vector map rendering, labeling and symbology for the web
  - This project is a complete web map renderer - including quality label layout, pattern fills, and icons - in as simple as possible of an implementation. 
  - It's an alternative to renderers like Mapbox GL JS in a fraction of the size.
  - Render static maps to Canvas elements or interactive maps with Leaflet integration
  - [what protomaps.js is, what protomaps.js is not](https://protomaps.com/docs/protomaps-js/)
    - It is not a continuous-zoom system. It displays map tiles at discrete integer zoom levels.
    - It is not a 3D renderer. Protomaps.js is focused on rendering 2D maps from OpenStreetMap data.
    - It is not based on WebGL. It instead uses the web-standard Canvas drawing API.
  - it works with PostGIS vector tiles! Added an example using @pwramsey 's pg_tileserv with Natural Earth data:

  - https://cartocss.readthedocs.io/
  - CartoCSS (short: Carto) is a language for map design.
  - It is similar in syntax to CSS, but builds upon it with specific abilities to filter map data and by providing things like variables.
  - It targets the Mapnik renderer and is able to generate Mapnik XML and a JSON variant of Mapnik XML. 
  - It can run from the command line or in the browser.

# collab

  - Draw, add markers, create lines and areas, find places to go, observe other users, and much more.
# map-app

  - https://leafmap.org/
  - A Python package for interactive mapping and geospatial analysis with minimal coding in a Jupyter environment

- https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling
  - This template is designed to accelerate building out a "scrollytelling" map story.
    - The output is an HTML and JavaScript file. 
    - These outputs can be hosted on any web-accessible location, with no extra code or infrastructure required. 
    - Note that embedding the output as an iFrame in another page will not work as expected. The scroll-driven interface requires the full page.
  - The template does not rely on any particular CSS framework, fonts, or images. 
    - There are some basic styles in the head of the HTML file that can be changed
