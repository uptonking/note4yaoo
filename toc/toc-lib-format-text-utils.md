  - Magika is a novel AI-powered file type detection tool that relies on the recent advance of deep learning to provide accurate detection.
  - Magika employs a custom, highly optimized model that only weighs about a few MBs, and enables precise file identification within milliseconds, even when running on a single CPU.
  - Magika is used at scale to help improve Google users' safety by routing Gmail, Drive, and Safe Browsing files to the proper security and content policy scanners
  - Available as a command line tool written in Rust, a Python API, and additional bindings for Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript 
  - [Announcing Magika 1.0: now faster, smarter, and rebuilt in Rust _202511](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/11/announcing-magika-10-now-faster-smarter.html)
  - [Over 40% of the Magisk's code has been rewritten in Rust : r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1l1o7x1/over_40_of_the_magisks_code_has_been_rewritten_in/)
    - Did they generate the rust code initially from the c++/c and then manually massage it to be efficient?
      - 👷 author here. The transition is fully manual, all code is slowly migrated one small component by a time, using cxx as the FFI mechanism. First I rewrite functions/subsystems that are fully independent with no dependencies on other parts of the codebase. After that, I rewrite components that do not have dependencies on other C++ code, and keep doing so iteratively. At some point, bidirectional FFI is less of a pain so I can just pick any random part of the codebase and rewrite it with little friction.
    - I don't use rust because it's faster or safer or whatever other hype. I use it because it has an incredibly good tool chain and the compiler tells me exactly what I did wrong, and sometimes even exactly how to fix it.

  - https://ace-diff.github.io/ace-diff/
  - A diff/merging wrapper for Ace Editor built on google-diff-match-patch
  - This is a wrapper for Ace Editor to provide a 2-panel diffing/merging tool that visualizes differences in two documents and allows users to copy changes from to the other.
  - It's built on top of google-diff-match-patch library. That lib handles the hard part: the computation of the document diffs. `ace-diff` just visualizes that information as line-diffs in the editors.

  - https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight /MIT/202310/js
    - Virtual syntax highlighting for virtual DOMs and non-HTML things
    - This package uses `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting and outputs objects (ASTs) instead of a string of HTML.
    - This package is useful when you want to perform syntax highlighting in a place where serialized HTML wouldn’t work or wouldn’t work well. 
    - You can use the similar `refractor` if you want to use `Prism` grammars instead. 
    - If you’re looking for a really good (but rather heavy) alternative, use `starry-night`.

  - A JavaScript text differencing implementation
  - Based on the algorithm proposed in "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" (Myers, 1986).
  - 支持按chars/words/lines比对，还支持patch
  - If you need behavior a little different to what any of the text diffing functions above offer, you can roll your own by customizing both the tokenization behavior used and the notion of equality used to determine if two tokens are equal.
  - jsdiff deviates from the published algorithm in a couple of ways that don't affect results but do affect performance:
    - jsdiff keeps track of the diff for each diagonal using a linked list of change objects for each diagonal, rather than the historical array of furthest-reaching D-paths on each diagonal contemplated on page 8 of Myers's paper.
    - jsdiff skips considering diagonals where the furthest-reaching D-path would go off the edge of the edit graph. This dramatically reduces the time cost (from quadratic to linear) in cases where the new text just appends or truncates content at the end of the old text.

- https://github.com/inkling/htmldiff.js /MIT/201803/js/inactive
  - Diff algorithm that understands HTML, in the browser.
  - htmldiff.js is a JavaScript port of https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff by Keanu Lee at Inkling.
