## üöß [GitHub Next | Realtime GitHub - Multiplayer collaboration for your whole repo](https://githubnext.com/projects/rtgh/)

- At GitHub Next we‚Äôve been exploring this question for some time: 
  - In the Collaborative Workspaces concept design, we imagined cloud workspaces that integrate different modes of development (ideation, design, coding, etc.) into a single interface, and provide realtime multiplayer collaboration in all these modes. 
  - And in the GitHub Blocks prototype, we made the GitHub repository page customizable, with interactive blocks to tailor it to your team‚Äôs development process.

- With Realtime GitHub, you can share a link (‚Äúmeet me in this branch!‚Äù) and instantly edit repository files together with your team. 
  - It‚Äôs still GitHub, so you can still work asynchronously‚Äîpull changes from another branch and merge your changes back when you‚Äôre ready.

## ‚ú® [GitHub Next | Flat Data](https://githubnext.com/projects/flat-data/)

- Flat explores how to make it easy to work with data in git and GitHub. 
  - It builds on the ‚Äúgit scraping‚Äù approach
  - https://github.com/githubocto/flat-demo-NASA-photo-of-the-day
    - This repository uses a Flat Data Action to fetch a JSON file with information about NASA's image of the day every day at 8 am UTC. Using a postprocessing script, Flat grabs the image URL within the JSON data and downloads the image as well.
  - https://github.com/githubocto/flat-demo-covid-dashboard
    - https://githubocto.github.io/flat-demo-covid-dashboard/
    - This uses a Flat Action to fetch data about COVID-19 and display it in a dashboard. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è [GitHub Blocks](https://blocks.githubnext.com/)

- The Blocks technical preview ended on 202312. Learn more about why Blocks is being sunset.

- [GitHub Next ‚Ä¢ Technical Preview Sunsets_202311](https://gist.github.com/idan/325676d192b32f169b032fde2d866c2c)
  - With regards to GitHub Blocks, blocks.githubnext.com will no longer work once the technical preview concludes and we will not make Blocks into a full GitHub product. 
  - Blocks was an exciting experiment and thanks to your feedback, we learned a lot about how we might add extensibility to GitHub.com. 
  - We expect GitHub will continue to explore this capability in the future, but for now we‚Äôre focusing our efforts on other areas.

  - Autopilot seems cool but:
    - Most of the time is spent thinking not typing.
    - Autocomplete is predictable, Autopilot much less so.
    - Spotting issues is IMO harder when reading code than when writing it.
    - You want perfect code, not code that the average dev would write.
