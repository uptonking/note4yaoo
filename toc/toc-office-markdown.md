  - [Lazy highlighting _202408](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/issues/1045)
    - The current render code seems to do everything in one sequential flow. As soon as it finds a fenced block it passes it though the highlight function. Which works fine if the highlighter being used is ready for it.
    - Loading them all in memory at once (like `highlight.js` allows) results in a MB big minified js file which i very much like to prevent.
    - But the render mechanism in markdown-it seems to be not so happy about a on-demand highlighter.
    - I fixed this by, at parse time, "remembering which fenced blocks" went through the parser and then, once parsed, go over those blocks again and load the syntax highlighting files. That works as lazy enough. It's quite a bit more involved then this but it works.

- https://github.com/lixpi/markdown-stream-parser /MIT/202509/ts
  - https://markdown-stream-parser.lixpi.org/
  - A library designed to incrementally parse Markdown text from a stream of tokens.
  - It's built to handle the ambiguities of LLM-generated streams, which often produce imperfect or invalid Markdown.
  - It combines a finite state machine with regex patterns to determine the best match for each segment.
  - [Evaluate whether continuing with completely custom parser implementation is reasonable, or shall we leverage lexers? _202505](https://github.com/Lixpi/markdown-stream-parser/issues/5)

- https://github.com/karminski/streaming-json-js /MIT/202409/js/inactive
  - This library allows for the parsing of JSON as it is being streamed (this means JSON stream can stops at any position), significantly cutting down the time-to-first-token.
  - https://github.com/karminski/streaming-json-go
  - https://github.com/karminski/streaming-json-py
  - handling multiple blobs or JSON with interspersed non-JSON strings can be quite tricky. This library is more focused on handling JSON strings themselves, so users need to manually separate JSON blobs for input or filter out non-JSON structured strings.
