- https://github.com/PRQL/prql /rust
  - https://prql-lang.org/
  - PRQL is a modern language for transforming data ‚Äî a simple, powerful, pipelined SQL replacement
  - Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and declarative. 
  - Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such as variables and functions. 
  - üëâüèª It can be used with any database that uses SQL, since it **compiles to SQL**.
  - PRQL's goals are fairly similar to @morel_lang , and the syntax looks similar in most cases.
