  - 依赖react-redux.v8、memoize-one、raf-schd、css-box-model
  - a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). 
    - it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. 
    - One shortcoming is that **grid layouts are not supported** (yet). 
  - No creation of additional wrapper dom nodes - flexbox and focus management friendly!
  - Movement between lists
  - Multi drag support
  - Tree support through the @atlaskit/tree package

  - https://www.dflex.dev/demo/lists/nested/
  - built with vanilla Javascript and implemented an enhanced transformation mechanism to manipulate DOM elements. 
  - It is by far the only Drag and Drop library on the internet that manipulates the DOM instead of reconstructing it and has its own scheduler and reconciler.
  - Support strict transformation between containers.

  - A vanilla JS draggable library
  - Lightweight multi-framework libraries for draggability on the web.
  - 支持vanillajs/react/vue/svelte/solid
  - Is the library also good for dragging items between lists?
    - Not directly, I'm afraid. This is for arbitrary dragging, not the sortable kind. You can use svelte-dnd-action or SortableJS for that for easy usage
