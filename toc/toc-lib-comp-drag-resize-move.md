  - Fast drag and drop for any experience on any tech stack
  - a low level drag and drop toolchain that enables safe and successful usage of the browsers built in drag and drop functionality. 
  - Pragmatic drag and drop can be used with any view layer (react, svelte, vue, angular and so on). 
  - Pragmatic drag and drop is powering some of the biggest products on the web, including Trello, Jira and Confluence.
  - We have created optional visual outputs (eg our drop indicator) to make it super fast for us to build consistent Atlassian user experiences. 
  - The optional assistive controls we provide are based on the Atlassian Design System.

  - 依赖react-redux.v8、memoize-one、raf-schd、css-box-model
  - a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). 
    - it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. 
    - One shortcoming is that **grid layouts are not supported** (yet). 
  - No creation of additional wrapper dom nodes - flexbox and focus management friendly!
  - Movement between lists
  - Multi drag support
  - Tree support through the @atlaskit/tree package

- https://github.com/formkit/drag-and-drop /MIT/202402/ts
  - https://drag-and-drop-docs.vercel.app/
  - a small library for adding data-first drag and drop sorting and transferring for lists in your app. 
  - It’s simple, flexible, framework agnostic, and clocks in at only ~4Kb gzipped.
  - "data-first" approach, "No direct DOM manipulations".
  - Drag and drop ships out of the box with the ability to sort and transfer individual items between lists. 
  - The multi-drag plugin allows you to select multiple items and drag them together.

- dflex /1.5kSStar/MIT/202302/ts
  - https://github.com/dflex-js/dflex
  - https://www.dflex.dev/demo/lists/nested/
  - built with vanilla Javascript and implemented an enhanced transformation mechanism to manipulate DOM elements. 
  - It is by far the only Drag and Drop library on the internet that manipulates the DOM instead of reconstructing it and has its own scheduler and reconciler.
  - Support strict transformation between containers.

  - A vanilla JS draggable library
  - Lightweight multi-framework libraries for draggability on the web.
  - 支持vanillajs/react/vue/svelte/solid
  - Is the library also good for dragging items between lists?
    - Not directly, I'm afraid. This is for arbitrary dragging, not the sortable kind. You can use svelte-dnd-action or SortableJS for that for easy usage
