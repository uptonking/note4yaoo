  - Redux store enhancers for tracking and visualizing state changes
  - 依赖react-redux、jsondiffpatch
  - todomvc在页面上展示op时间轴的示例，可自动播放，无需devtools，直接在页面上展示
  - Inspired by the redux devtools and redux slider monitor, this package provides state recording/playback (i.e. "time travel") abilities for redux applications.
  - Only state diffs are stored for each state change (performance untested for large state/long running applications).
  - Decoupled recording/debugging code
  - Import/Export histories: Play them back locally, including realtime speed.
  - Time-travel is "pure": That is, state history changes without refiring the actual actions that produced said change (so still works for impure/async actions).
  - A store enhancer provides the history tracking on each state change, recording the state change, the timestamp of the change, and the action type that produced said change.

  - https://www.nicoespeon.com/gitgraph.js/stories/
  - A JavaScript library to draw pretty git graphs in the browser
  - core无依赖，支持vanillajs、React
  - @gitgraph/core contains the main logic for manipulating git-like API and compute the graph that should be rendered.

- https://github.com/sdq/history-tree /201901/js
  - https://sdq.github.io/history-tree/
  - An interactive history tree for undo/redo/reset/revisit in javascript

- https://github.com/philipmendels/undomundo /202204/ts/依赖fp-ts
  - a library for managing an action-based undo history, with support for time travel and branching. 
  - It can be used in a multi-user setting because it allows for modification of the history at the time of undo/redo, as visually explained in this blog article from Figma.
  - Undomundo does not enable you to declare in advance which actions should be grouped/skipped and under which circumstances. You can however skip actions on a per-call basis
  - https://github.com/philipmendels/use-flexible-undo
    - React hook that lets you use undomundo's branching undo/redo functionality independently of how you structure your application state

- https://github.com/mikolalysenko/version-tree /201404/js/inactive
  - A data structure for maintaining a tree of versions. 
  - This can be useful when implementing fully persistent data structures using the DTSS method. 
  - Works in both node.js and browserify. 
  - All operations use amortized O(1) space and time.

- https://github.com/JasonStoltz/branch-js /201510/js
  - A utility to track and apply changes to javascript objects as if they were git branches.
  - "branching" lets you make changes to an object without directly affecting the original object until you are ready to "merge" those changes back in.
  - The most applicable use case for this is probably forms.

- https://github.com/dxinteractive/dendriform /202207/ts
  - Build performant, reactive data-editing UIs for React.js
  - Dendriform is less specific and far more adaptable, to be used to make entire UIs where allowing the user to edit data is the goal. 
  - Use `.branch()` to deeply access parts of your form's value. This returns another form, containing just the deep value.
  - "Dendriform" means "tree shaped", referencing the tree-like manner in which you can traverse and render the parts of a deep data shape.

- https://github.com/haydn/use-state-snapshots /201906/js
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/use-state-snapshots-i6fuq
  - A React hook to keep track of state changes for undo/redo functionality
  - Drop-in replacement for `useState` including support for functional updates and lazy initial state.
  - Three ways to track changes:
    - Automatically create new snapshots at regular intervals.
    - Automatically create a snapshot for every single change to state.
    - Only create snapshots for specific changes to state.
  - Configurable limit for the number of snapshots to keep.

- https://github.com/nytimes/ice /201402/js/NoDeps/inactive
  - https://nytimes.github.io/ice/demo/
  - Ice is a track changes implementation, built in javascript, for anything that is `contenteditable` on the web. 
  - Conceived(想出；构思) by the CMS Group at The New York Times, ice is powering the editor used for writing articles in the newsroom.
  - [Online Contract Editor problem](https://github.com/nytimes/ice/issues/146)
    - as someone who has contributed quite a bit to this library in the past, I feel obliged to tell you that this library is quite out of date and in many ways unfixable due to the way it is structured as browsers are changing those parts that this library touches all the time.
    - I would recommend going with an editing library that maintains its own model of the content - such as ProseMirror or CKEditor 5 and build tracked changes on top of that.

- https://github.com/open-source-labs/reactime /2.1kStar/MIT/202310/ts
  - https://www.reacti.me/
  - an open-source Chrome developer tool for time travel debugging and performance monitoring in React applications. 
  - Reactime enables developers to record snapshots of application state, jump between and inspect state snapshots, and monitor performance metrics such as component render time and render frequency.
  - Whenever the state is changed (whenever setState, useState is called), this extension will create a snapshot of the current state tree and record it
  - jump to any previously recorded snapshots

  - Redux Implementation of Undo/Redo based on storing actions instead of states.
  - Actions are stored in an array named history. 
  - 🐛🆚️ The most popular and used library to add undo/redo functionality to redux is without a doubt redux-undo. It stores whole states instead of actions. This is great for small states and fat actions, but does not scale well if the state tree grows and especially if state is persisted.
  - It really just boils down to if your state is fat and your actions are thin or your state is thin and your actions are fat.

  - Placing labels on a timeline without overlap.
  - If you try to place labels for points on a timeline (or any 1D space), one common problem is the labels often overlap.
  - Force is the main engine that takes your nodes (labels) and figures out where to place them on the screen. 
    - There are actually two steps in this process: distribute and remove overlap(s)
    - In the distribute step, the nodes are split into multiple layers if all nodes cannot fit within one layer. 
    - In the remove overlap(s) step, Labella employs a constraint-based layout algorithm and uses special quadratric programming solver called VPSC to find the best location to place the nodes. 
  - labella.js does not require D3 to function though. It is a standalone library with no dependency. D3 was only used in the examples for demoing purpose
