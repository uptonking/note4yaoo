  - https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/tree/css-variables-with-fallback
    - I've been working on this CSS Variables + HSL version of Bulma.
      - The idea is to provide each value as a separate variable, so you can tweak the H, S or L independently. 
      - That way you can theme a whole page dynamically.
    - The main issue is that it requires close to 100 CSS Variables to be applied to `:root`. 
      - While this is done automatically, it might be considered noisy and verbose. 
      - It is however the most flexible approach for theming a CSS framework.
