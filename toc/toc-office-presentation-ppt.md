# guide
- tips
  - 商业化的演示更偏向类似tableau的图形编辑器，而不是文字
  - 侧重信息的ppt上更多的是文字数字，而不是花里胡哨的图形，此时pdf比ppt更合适，很多pdf由ppt转换得到
  - 技术栈基于svg容易实现缩放，基于dom不容易缩放, ppt需要缩放吗

- dev-xp
  - ui组件都可分为state、view2部分，editor框架的核心是通过view更新state
  - ppt可以每页放一个画板或富文本编辑器

- alternatives-ppt
  - 很多ppt的每页是一张图片
  - 只需ppt的viewer，presentation常是各个系统的核心功能
  - ✨ pdf-editor与ppt-editor的相似点: 支持批注、左侧页面缩略图
  - 可参考: svg-editor, pdf-editor, drawio

  - Create PowerPoint presentations with a powerful, concise JavaScript API.
  - This library creates Open Office XML (OOXML) Presentations which are compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, and other applications.
  - Integrates with Node, Angular, React, and Electron
  - All major object types are available (charts, shapes, tables, etc.)
  - SVG images, animated gifs, YouTube videos, RTL text, and Asian fonts
  - PowerPoint shape definitions and some XML code via Officegen Project

  - 🚧 [Unimplemented Features](https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS/wiki/Unimplemented-Features)
    - Animations, Importing Existing ppt, SmartArt, Outlines
  - [Is it possible to read and update a PPTX file using PpptxGenJS? _202206](https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS/discussions/1120)
    - This library only generates new presentations. Reading existing presentations is an existing item on the Unimplemented Features
  - [Rendering of PPTX on screen _202303](https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS/issues/1230)
    - You're basically reproducing the functionality of M365 online (turning PPTX and/or code into HTML) while this library produces XML documents.
  - [WYSIWYG Editor or Playground _201706](https://github.com/gitbrent/PptxGenJS/issues/109)
    - Since the PptxGenJS library produces XML, I don't see how to easily translate that to HTML and then keep a canvas or div element populated. That's basically what the PowerPoint Online engine does.

  - [Question: Is the online editor available in the source?](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/971)
    - the slides.com editor isn't open source
  - [Export reveal.js presentation to .odp or .ppt presentation _201609](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/1702)
    - Currently there isn't such a way, as Reveal.js presentations are just webpages, and they would be difficult to convert to specific proprietary `.ppt/.odp` slides. 
    - PDF printing is currently the easiest way to export presentations.
    - 💡 The best way is to write the presentation in Markdown and then process it with Pandoc into both reveal.js and PowerPoint, as well as other formats.
    - Pandoc can also convert from PowerPoint to Markdown, but the result is normally not usable without a lot of touching up.
