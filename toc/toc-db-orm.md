- typeorm /30.1kStar/MIT/202301/ts
  - https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm
  - http://typeorm.io/
  - TypeORM is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
  - Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server, Oracle, SAP Hana, sql.js.
  - Supports MongoDB NoSQL database.
  - 使用示例是装饰器风格
  - ✨ TypeORM supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns
  - 依赖date-fns, reflect-metadata, buffer

- mikro-orm /5.5kStar/MIT/202301/ts/开发者主程只有1个
  - https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm
  - https://mikro-orm.io/
  - TypeScript ORM for Node.js based on Data Mapper, Unit of Work and Identity Map patterns.
  - 依赖esprima、dataloader、acorn-loose、fs-extra、reflect-metadata、knex
  - 使用示例是装饰器风格
  - Supports MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite databases.
  - Heavily inspired by Doctrine and Nextras Orm. (两者都为PHP设计)
  - Unit of Work maintains a list of objects (entities) affected by a business transaction and coordinates the writing out of changes. 
  - Identity Map ensures that each object (entity) gets loaded only once by keeping every loaded object in a map. Looks up objects using the map when referring to them. 
  - [MikroORM 3: Knex.js, CLI, Schema Updates _202001](https://mikro-orm.io/blog/mikro-orm-3-released)

    - With Knex.js used as a query runner, support for connection pooling is finally available
  - [Who uses MikroORM in production?](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm/issues/296)
    - Mikro relies on `Knex` to create and manage the connection
    - Even if I don't have much time for feature development in the future, I've always preferred fixing bugs and helping out others with issues
  - [Choosing the Right TypeScript ORM: MikroORM vs. TypeORM _202308](https://medium.com/@mybytecode/choosing-the-right-typescript-orm-mikroorm-vs-typeorm-fed5d7d9b514)

  - https://github.com/prisma/prisma
  - https://www.prisma.io/
  - Modern database access (ORM alternative) for Node.js & TypeScript | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB & SQLite
  - Prisma Client: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript
    - used in any Node.js or TypeScript backend application (including serverless applications and microservices). 
    - This can be a REST API, a GraphQL API, a gRPC API 
    - ORM是映射数据库的表到编程语言上的类。
    - 而Prisma是一个数据库工具，能够根据数据模型生成特定的查询工具。
    - Prisma会根据数据库的Schema，生成js的客户端库。在里面定义了相应的数据接口，关联关系和函数等。通过这些，来完成对数据的操作
  - Prisma Migrate: Declarative data modeling & migration system
  - Prisma Studio: GUI to view and edit data in your database
  - [为什么要用 Prisma？](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/142607078)
    - 自己手写SQL：控制力极强，生产力弱
      - 可以完全控制数据库操作，但是，生产力却不高，而且会遇到很多细碎的事情（如手动处理链接、操作模板）
      - 另一个问题在于你获取的查询结果时不是类型安全的，你可能会手动书写这些查询结果的类型
      - 手动构造SQL字符串的时候，编辑器没法给你任何提示
    - SQL构造器：控制力强，生产力一般
      - 使用SQL构造器（如 knext.js）以提高生产力，这种工具为构建 SQL 语句提供了封装层次较高的 API
      - 最大的问题在于这种工具需要开发者从 SQL 的角度来对待数据，但应用数据往往是关系型的对象，开发者不得不经常切换思维模型才能写好 SQL 语句。
    - ORM：控制力弱，生产力不错
      - ORM可以让开发者将所有数据定义为 class，一个 class 就是一个数据表，开发者不需要对 SQL 有那么深的理解了。
      - 可以通过 class 的方法来对数据库进行读写，非常方便
      - 开发者将数据理解为一个一个的对象集合，但实际上这些数据是一个一个的表。
      - 上个例子揭露了ORM的一个大陷阱：使用 ORM 表面上可以通过点符合来访问另一个实体，但是私底下却会构造 SQL JOIN 语句，这些 JOIN 是有性能陷阱的，很可能把你的应用拖得很慢，比如著名的 n+1 问题。
      - ORM的优点是抽象出关系模型并仅根据对象来操作数据。但是问题在于，关系型数据表并不能轻松地映射到对象，这会带来很多复杂性
    - Prisma：更高的生产力
      - 主要目标就是让开发者在处理数据库是更具生产力
      - 用对象来思考，而不是在大脑中映射关系型数据库
      - 数据库和数据模型来自同一个地方
      - 控制力高于SQL构造器，低于手写SQL； 但生产力最高

- https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb /918Star/MIT/202311/rust
  - https://bonsaidb.io/
  - A programmable document database inspired by `CouchDB` written in Rust.
  - ACID-compliant, transactional storage of Collections
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Local-only access, networked access via QUIC, or networked access via WebSockets
  - [Introducing PliantDb](https://ecton.dev/introducing-pliantdb/)
  - [Branch support](https://github.com/khonsulabs/nebari/issues/29)
    - For BonsaiDb we plan on supporting the replication logic at the BonsaiDb level, and we are hoping to support bi-directional replication with customizable conflict resolution. 
    - This is a form of branching, because you can clone a database using replication, modify it, and then eventually replicate again in either direction.
  - [Project Status_202301](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb/issues/262)
    - One serious thought I still have is whether Nebari should exist, or whether BonsaiDb should just use another database format. 
  - https://github.com/khonsulabs/nebari /rust
    - A pure Rust database implementation using an append-only B-Tree file format.
    - This crate provides the Roots type, which is the transactional storage layer for BonsaiDb. It is loosely inspired by `Couchstore`.
    - This crate blocks the current thread when accessing the filesystem. If you are looking for an async-ready database, BonsaiDb is our vision of an async-aware database built atop Nebari.
    - Nebari exposes multiple levels of functionality. The lowest level functionality is the `TreeFile`. A `TreeFile` is a key-value store that uses an append-only file format for its implementation.
    - Using TreeFiles and a transaction log, Roots enables ACID-compliant, multi-tree transactions.
  - Why use an append-only file format?
    - Creating ACID-compliance with append-only formats is much easier to achieve, however, as long as you can guarantee two things:
    - When opening a previously existing file, can you identify where the last valid write occurred?
    - When writing the file, do not report that a transaction has succeeded until the file is fully flushed to disk.
    - The B-Tree implementation in Nebari is designed to offer those exact guarantees.
    - The major downside of append-only formats is that deleted data isn't cleaned up until a maintenance process occurs: compaction. 

- https://github.com/mozilla/mentat /201809/rust/inactive
  - https://mozilla.github.io/mentat/
  - A persistent, relational store inspired by Datomic and DataScript
  - Mentat is intended to be a flexible relational (not key-value, not document-oriented) store that makes it easy to describe, grow, and reuse your domain schema.
  - Just like DataScript, Mentat speaks Datalog for querying and takes additions and retractions as input to a transaction.
  - Unlike DataScript, Mentat exposes free-text indexing, **thanks to SQLite**.
  - Mentat was designed for embedding, initially in an experimental Electron app 
  - Mentat uses partial indices, which are available in SQLite 3.8.0 and higher

  - https://objectbox.io/
  - Java and Android Database - fast and lightweight without any ORM
  - ObjectBox is a NoSQL Java database designed for local data storage on resource-restricted devices, prioritizing offline-first functionality. 
  - It is a smart and sustainable choice for local data persistence in Java and Kotlin applications.
  - built-in support for object relations, allowing you to easily establish and manage relationships between objects.
  - concise API that eliminates the need for complex SQL queries, saving you time and effort during development.
  - [ObjectBox is not entirely FOSS](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-java/issues/1102)
    - it isn't open source. The language wrappers are apache2 but the core library is only provided as a binary blob.
    - ObjectBox bindings are open sourced under Apache 2.0; accessing the ObjectBox core is possible with a commercial licence that also includes support. The reason is that it is mainly big B2B IoT users that need access and support - and these customers allow us to maintain ObjectBox DB free to use for (almost) everyone else.

  - Provides extraordinary performance, minimal overhead through Memory-Mapping and Olog(N) operations costs by virtue of B+ tree.
  - Compact and friendly for fully embedding. Only ≈25KLOC of C11, ≈64K x86 binary code of core, no internal threads neither server process(es), but implements a simplified variant of the Berkeley DB and dbm API.
  - Historically, libmdbx is a deeply revised and extended descendant of the amazing Lightning Memory-Mapped Database. libmdbx inherits all benefits from LMDB, but resolves some issues and adds a set of improvements.

- https://github.com/hoytech/quadrable /cpp
  - an authenticated multi-version database that can efficiently sync itself with remote instances. 
  - It is implemented as a sparse binary merkle tree with compact partial-tree proofs. 
  - Many different versions of the database can exist at the same time. Deriving one version from another doesn't require copying the database. Instead, all of the data that is common between the versions is shared. This copy-on-write behaviour allows very inexpensive database snapshots and checkpoints.
  - applications can synchronise with remote instances. Conflict-handling is flexible, and can work by either cloning one side or by merging the states together (like a CRDT)
