- https://github.com/HeflerDev/CSStack
  - CSStack is a tiny CSS Grid framework built in SASS focused on the construction of the page structure. 
  - It is simple and easy-to-use, aiming to keep the CSS only for styling(fonts, colors...) and polluting it with less lines.
  - It has a responsive columns feature mixed with 'a box inside a box' concept which helps getting those nasty elements in the place you want.

  - CSS layout components that (basically) horizontally and vertically stack anything.
- https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/layers.css

  - https://docs.spaceframework.dev/
  - The framework helps you with centralizing typography and the preserving of equivalent spaces between elements.
