  - An HTML5 saveAs() FileSaver implementation
  - FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is perfect for web apps that generates files on the client, 
  - However if the file is coming from the server we recommend you to first try to use `Content-Disposition` attachment response header as it has more cross-browser compatibility.

- https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js /js
  - the solution to saving streams in the web browser. 
  - It is perfect for web apps where there's a need to save large amounts of data on devices with e.g. limited RAM.
  - This is accomplish by emulating how a server would instruct the browser to save a file using some response header + service worker
  - there is this new native way to save files to the HD:

  - This file holds the synchronous half of an sqlite3_vfs
  implementation which proxies, in a synchronous fashion, the
  asynchronous Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) APIs using a second
  Worker, implemented in sqlite3-opfs-async-proxy.js.

- https://github.com/wariasar/opfs
  - https://v22018096896673253.goodsrv.de/opfs/

  - 支持 memory/localStorage/indexeddb/dropbox/Emscripten file systems
  - [File System Access Backend by DustinBrett](https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS/pull/321)
    - I won't be using it by default in my project with OPFS instead of IndexedDb because it has other limits such as not allowing the making of `.url` files. 
    - I also wrote a benchmark and found it interesting that OPFS was not faster. But maybe this could be improved in the code I wrote

- https://github.com/tomayac/opfs-explorer
  - OPFS Explorer is a Chrome DevTools extension that allows you to explore the Origin Private File System (OPFS) of a web application.

- https://github.com/qwtel/sqlite-viewer-vscode  /ts
  - https://sqliteviewer.app/
  - easy SQLite viewer for VSCode, inspired by DB Browser for SQLite and Airtable.
  - [Next version of SQLite Viewer, handling 3 million rows, 1 GB sqlite file, in a browser.](https://twitter.com/qwtel/status/1639204056622321664)
    - Memory usage low despite 1GB file, thanks to OPFS and SQLite WASM
  - [Opening large SQLite files is solved in the (unreleased) web version though.](https://twitter.com/qwtel/status/1644319722178248708)
    - The limit is now how much the browser permits to write into the Origin Private File System.
  - I'm surprised the current version of SQLite Viewer keeps getting good reviews in the vsc marketplace. It flat out crashes if you open a large file. I suppose most sqlite files are small.
    - Unfortunately fixing it would be hard. 
    - vsc's own `fs` module doesn't let you read with random offsets, and even if it did, it would require writing a custom VFS and juggling buffers across 2-3 layers of iframes and workers.

# file-folder-dir-scan-watch
- 文件编辑浏览的实现思路
  - edit > ~~save(内存或本地)~~ > render
  - 文件逐个处理

- `fs.watch(filename[, options][, listener])`.
  - Watch for changes on `filename`, where `filename` is either a file or a directory.
  - The `listener` callback gets two arguments (eventType, filename). `eventType` is either 'rename' or 'change', and `filename` is the name of the file which triggered the event.
  - The `fs.watch` API is not 100% consistent across platforms, and is unavailable in some situations.
  - If the underlying functionality is not available for some reason, then fs.watch() will not be able to function and may thrown an exception.
  - It is still possible to use `fs.watchFile()`, which uses stat polling, but this method is slower and less reliable.

- `fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener)`.
  - Watch for changes on `filename`.
  - The callback listener will be called each time the file is accessed.
  - The `listener` gets two arguments the current stat object and the previous stat object(instances of fs. Stat)
  - To be notified when the file was modified, not just accessed, it is necessary to compare `curr.mtime` and `prev.mtime`.
  - `fs.watch()` is more efficient than `fs.watchFile` and fs.unwatchFile

- nodemon
  - is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
  - [Don’t use nodemon, there are better ways!](https://codeburst.io/dont-use-nodemon-there-are-better-ways-fc016b50b45e)
    - Solution: don’t restart the server
    - use `chokidar` to watch the files
  - I am generally not a fan of nodemon as a workflow for basically this reason.
    - If I'm in a sandbox usually fine to 'hot load' and run whatever code on save.
    - If I'm in node, I always want manual control over *what* changes run and *when*.
  - In fact I don't even use nodemon on my machine.
    - It always leaves zombie processes running on my machine.
    - I have to kill them manually by looking them up by opened port.

- https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar
  - file watcher used in MS VSCode.
  - Minimal and efficient cross-platform file watching library
  - On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API.
  - On most other platforms, the fs.watch-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down.

- https://github.com/webpack/watchpack
  - 不依赖chokidar，依赖graceful-fs，由webpack开发
  - watchpack high level API doesn't map directly to watchers.
  - Instead a three level architecture ensures that for each directory only a single watcher exists.

- https://github.com/Qard/onchange
  - 依赖chokidar
  - Use glob patterns to watch file sets and run a command when anything is added, changed or deleted.
- https://github.com/fabiospampinato/watcher
  - The file system watcher, with no native dependencies and optional rename detection support.
  - Node's built-in `fs.watch` function is garbage and you never want to use it directly.
    - Recursive watching is not supported under Linux
    - the events provided by fs.watch are completely useless as they tell you nothing about what actually happened in the file system
  - `chokidar` requires a native dependency for efficient recursive watching under macOS
  - It doesn't watch recursively efficiently under Windows

- https://github.com/tapio/live-server
  - 依赖chokidar、colors、connect、event-stream、faye-websocket、htp-auth、morgan、opn、proxy-middleware、send、serve-index
    - 不建议使用，推荐使用依赖livereload-js的node-livereload
  - a little development server with live reload capability.
  - Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate dev
  - If you don't want/need the live reload, you should probably use something simpler, like python -m SimpleHTTPServer/http.server 8999
  - https://github.com/geelen/jspm-server
    - It's based on @tapio's excellent live-server
- https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js
  - 无依赖
  - 示例依赖watchify，watchify依赖chokidar
  - To use LiveReload, you need a client (this script) in your browser and a server running on your development machine
  - This repository (livereload.js) implements the client side of the protocol.
  - The client connects to a LiveReload server via web sockets and listens for incoming change notifications.
  - It gets change notifications from a LiveReload server and applies them to the browser.
  - If you are developing a LiveReload server, see dist/livereload.js for the latest version built using the sources in this repository.
  - We require LiveReload server vendors to distribute livereload.js as part of their apps or tools.
- https://github.com/napcs/node-livereload
  - Current maintained fork of LiveReload server in Node.js
  - 依赖 chokidar、livereload-js、ws、opts
  - 注意：文件更新消息的发送，使用的是ws协议，需要在浏览器中访问file:///path/to/test.html，而不是http://localhost:35729/test.html

- https://github.com/mihneadb/node-directory-tree
  - http://livereload.com/
  - Creates a JS object representing a directory tree.
  - const dirTree = require("directory-tree"); 
  - const tree = dirTree("/some/path"); 
- https://github.com/euberdeveloper/dree
  - 只依赖yargs
  - A nodejs module which helps you handle a directory tree.
  -  It provides you an object of a directory tree with custom configuration and optional callback method when a file or dir is scanned.
  - const dree = require('dree'); 
  - const tree = dree.scan('./folder', options); 

- https://github.com/jkomyno/pate
  - 依赖glob, yargs, chalk, progress
  - pate is a library that, given a RegExp pattern and a folder path, filters out every nested file in that folder which doesn't match the pattern.
  - Optionally it's possible either to write the list of files that match to a file, to log every single action that's happening internally, or even to filter the files via a glob pattern.

  - An offline-first shared data library for creating p2p apps that work in the browser (and now also NodeJs).
  - HHS uses an immutable typed-objects local storage model. 
    - Objects are both retrieved and cross-referenced using a structural hash of their contents as their id (a form of content-based addressing).
  - Mutability is implemented using CRDTs. Identities and data authentication are cryptographic.
  - Objects and their references form an immutable DAG, a fact that is used for data replication in HHS p2p mesh.

- ## Use `fetch()` to check if a file exists without downloading the entire thing.
- https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1712485929255051592
- For cases where `HEAD` is not supported (ex. S3 GET signed URL), you can also do a `GET` with the `Range` header and get only the first byte to confirm the file.
  - Would this be the code? `fetch('...', { headers: { Range: 'bytes=0-0' }})` ; 
  - Correct, by doing so you don't need to worry about the server supporting HEAD, very handy
- Wouldn’t that require also to finish the request via .text(), as example, to avoid dangling promises around? 
  - not sure. 是否要手动释放资源

- ## To find out whether a file is UTF-8 text file in browser.
- https://twitter.com/__enix__/status/1681710341372117003
  - This is especially FAST when compared to the common solution that loads the whole file as a BLOB into memory.

```JS
const decoder = new TextDecoderStream()

file.stream().pipeTo(decoder.writable);

const reader = decoder.readable.getReader();

const { done, value } = await reader.read()

// unrecognized bytes will be turned into \ufffd
if (value?.includes('\ufffd')) {
  return false;
}
```
