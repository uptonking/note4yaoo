  - https://localforage.github.io/localForage
  - localForage is a fast and simple storage library for JavaScript. 
  - localForage improves the offline experience of your web app by using asynchronous storage (IndexedDB or WebSQL) with a simple `localStorage`-like API.
  - localForage uses `localStorage` in browsers with no IndexedDB or WebSQL support.
  - You can store any type in localForage; localForage automatically does `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` when getting/setting values.
  - localForage supports storing all native JS objects that can be serialized to JSON, as well as ArrayBuffers, Blobs, and TypedArrays
  - You can create multiple instances of localForage that point to different stores using `createInstance`.

  - A Firebase-Style Database ... Offline!
  - Localbase is built on top of LocalForage.
  - Localbase gives you an offline database with the simplicity & power of Firebase, all stored in the user's browser (in an IndexedDB database).
  - You can create as many databases as you like.
  - Databases are organised into Collections and Documents (just like Firebase Cloud Firestore).
    - Databases contain Collections (e.g. users)
    - Collections contain Documents (e.g. { id: 1, name: 'Bill', age: 47 }

  - ‰æùËµñrxjs7
  - A fast, offline-first, reactive database for JavaScript Applications
  - a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps and NodeJs. 
  - üëâüèª RxDB is not a self contained database. 
    - It is a wrapper around another database that implements the `RxStorage` interface. 
    - At the moment you can either use `PouchDB` or `Dexie.js` or `LokiJS` as underlaying storage. 
    - Each of them respectively has it's own adapters that can be swapped out, depending on your needs. 
    - For example you can use and IndexedDB based storage in the browser, and an SQLite storage in your hybrid app

  - Previously, I've created localstorage-ponyfill for this purpose. 
    - However `Window.localStorage` does not work on Web Workers or Service Worker
  - @kvs/* packages provide async storage API using IndexedDB etc and resolve this issue.

- https://github.com/gruns/ImmortalDB /202008/js/inactive
  - the best way to store persistent key-value data in the browser. 
  - Data saved to ImmortalDB is redundantly stored in Cookies, IndexedDB, and LocalStorage, and relentlessly self heals if any data therein is deleted or corrupted.

  - CamaDB is a NoSQL embedded database written in pure TypeScript for Node, Electron and browser-based environments
  - I was struggling to find a solution for Electron-based projects that deal with larger datasets in the main thread.
    - I had issues getting SQLite to work with webpack due to its native build
    - SQLite doesn't (by default) return native JS data types (Dates in particular)
    - Other NoSQL embedded databases seem to be largely abandoned
    - Most other NoSQL embedded databases seem to be limited by V8's hard string length limits

- lovefield /6.8kStar/Apache2/202005/js
  - https://github.com/google/lovefield

- https://github.com/microsoft/ObjectStoreProvider /202207/ts
  - A cross-browser/platform indexeddb-like client library
  - We developed ObjectStoreProvider after needing a simplified interface toobject storage/retrieval that worked not only across all browsers. We also have built a fully in-memory database provider that has no persistence but supports fully transactional semantics
  - This project has some notable differences to NoSqlProvider
    - It uses red-black tree based indices for better performance of the inMemory provider
- https://github.com/microsoft/NoSQLProvider /ts/inactive
  - A cross-browser/platform indexeddb-like client library
  - We developed NoSQLProvider after needing a simplified interface to NoSQL-style object storage/retrieval that worked not only across all browsers, but also for native app development (initially Cordova-based, later moving to React Native.) 
  - Across the browsers, this required unifying WebSQL and IndexedDB, with the nuances of all the different IndexedDB issues
  - We also have built a fully in-memory database provider that has no persistence but supports fully transactional semantics, for a fallback in situations where you don't want persistence
