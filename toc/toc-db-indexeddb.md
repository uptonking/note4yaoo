- minimongo /1kStar/LGPLv3/202207/ts/Â§öÁßçwebÂ≠òÂÇ®
  - https://github.com/mWater/minimongo
  - A client-side MongoDB implementation which supports basic queries, including some geospatial ones.
  - It is either IndexedDb backed (IndexedDb), WebSQL backed (WebSQLDb), Local storage backed (LocalStorageDb) or in memory only (MemoryDb).
  - sqlite plugin is also supported when available
  - Uses code from Meteor.js minimongo package, reworked to support more geospatial queries. It was forked in January 2014.

- nedb /13.1kStar/MIT/201602/js/Â§öÁßçwebÂ≠òÂÇ®
  - https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb
  - Embedded persistent or in memory database for Node.js, nw.js, Electron and browsers, 100% JavaScript, no binary dependency.
  - API is a subset of MongoDB's and it's plenty fast.
  - You can use NeDB as an in-memory only datastore or as a persistent datastore. 
  - One datastore is the equivalent of a MongoDB collection
  - Under the hood, NeDB's persistence uses an append-only format, meaning that all updates and deletes actually result in lines added at the end of the datafile, for performance reasons.
  - If you specify a filename, the database will be persistent, and automatically select the best storage method available (IndexedDB, WebSQL or localStorage) depending on the browser.

  - Localbase is built on top of LocalForage.
  - Localbase gives you an offline database with the simplicity & power of Firebase, all stored in the user's browser (in an IndexedDB database).
  - You can create as many databases as you like.
  - Databases are organised into Collections and Documents (just like Firebase Cloud Firestore).
    - Databases contain Collections (e.g. users)
    - Collections contain Documents (e.g. { id: 1, name: 'Bill', age: 47 }

  - https://erikolson186.github.io/zangodb/
  - a MongoDB-like interface for HTML5 IndexedDB that supports most of the familiar filtering, projection, sorting, updating and aggregation features of MongoDB, for usage in the web browser.
  - The following aggregation pipeline stages are supported: $match, $project, $group, $unwind, $sort, $skip, and $limit.
  - an implementation of IndexedDB is required. 
    - For environments without a native implementation of IndexedDB, Fake IndexedDB can be used

  - ‰æùËµñrxjs7
  - A fast, offline-first, reactive database for JavaScript Applications
  - a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps and NodeJs. 
  - üëâüèª RxDB is not a self contained database. 
    - It is a wrapper around another database that implements the `RxStorage` interface. 
    - At the moment you can either use `PouchDB` or `Dexie.js` or `LokiJS` as underlaying storage. 
    - Each of them respectively has it's own adapters that can be swapped out, depending on your needs. 
    - For example you can use and IndexedDB based storage in the browser, and an SQLite storage in your hybrid app

- kvs /125Star/MIT/202209/ts
  - https://github.com/azu/kvs
  - Key Value storage for Browser, Node.js, and In-Memory.
  - I want to get universal storage library that works on Browser and Node.js.
  - Previously, I've created localstorage-ponyfill for this purpose. 
    - However,  `Window.localStorage` does not work on Web Workers or Service Worker
  - @kvs/* packages provide async storage API using IndexedDB etc and resolve this issue.

- https://github.com/gruns/ImmortalDB /202008/js/inactive
  - the best way to store persistent key-value data in the browser. 
  - Data saved to ImmortalDB is redundantly stored in Cookies, IndexedDB, and LocalStorage, and relentlessly self heals if any data therein is deleted or corrupted.

- https://github.com/elmarti/camadb /202110/ts/inactive
  - CamaDB is a NoSQL embedded database written in pure TypeScript for Node, Electron and browser-based environments
  - I was struggling to find a solution for Electron-based projects that deal with larger datasets in the main thread.
    - I had issues getting SQLite to work with webpack due to its native build
    - SQLite doesn't (by default) return native JS data types (Dates in particular)
    - Other NoSQL embedded databases seem to be largely abandoned
    - Most other NoSQL embedded databases seem to be limited by V8's hard string length limits

- lovefield /6.8kStar/Apache2/202005/js
  - https://github.com/google/lovefield
  - Lovefield is a relational database written in pure JavaScript.

- https://github.com/microsoft/ObjectStoreProvider /202207/ts
  - A cross-browser/platform indexeddb-like client library
  - We developed ObjectStoreProvider after needing a simplified interface toobject storage/retrieval that worked not only across all browsers. We also have built a fully in-memory database provider that has no persistence but supports fully transactional semantics
  - This project has some notable differences to NoSqlProvider
    - It uses red-black tree based indices for better performance of the inMemory provider
- https://github.com/microsoft/NoSQLProvider /ts/inactive
  - A cross-browser/platform indexeddb-like client library
  - We developed NoSQLProvider after needing a simplified interface to NoSQL-style object storage/retrieval that worked not only across all browsers, but also for native app development (initially Cordova-based, later moving to React Native.) 
  - Across the browsers, this required unifying WebSQL and IndexedDB, with the nuances of all the different IndexedDB issues
  - We also have built a fully in-memory database provider that has no persistence but supports fully transactional semantics, for a fallback in situations where you don't want persistence

- https://github.com/YeloPartyHat/LocalDatabase

  - A limitation of IndexedDB is that you can only perform 1 write operation at a time. Currently, IndexedDB also limits you to only having 1 instance open per browser!
    - This means that if you implement this you won't be able to run this database in multiple tabs due to limitations of IndexedDB.
