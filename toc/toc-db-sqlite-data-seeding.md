- https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila /202409/psql
  - Pagila started as a port of the Sakila example database available for MySQL, which was originally developed by Mike Hillyer of the MySQL AB documentation team. 
  - It is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, etc.
  - Pagila has been tested against PostgreSQL 12 and above.
  - Fulltext functionality is built in PostgreSQL, so parts of the schema exist in the main schema file.
  - The payment table is designed as a partitioned table with a 7 month timespan for the date ranges.
  - The pagila database is made available under PostgreSQL license.
