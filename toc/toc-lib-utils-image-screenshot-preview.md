# js-screenshot
- https://github.com/niklasvh/html2canvas /ts
  - https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/
  - Screenshots with JavaScript
  - The script allows you to take "screenshots" of webpages or parts of it, directly on the users browser.
  - how it works
    - The script renders the current page as a canvas image, by reading the DOM and the different styles applied to the elements.
    - It does not require any rendering from the server, as the whole image is created on the client's browser. 
    - However, as it is heavily dependent on the browser, this library is not suitable to be used in nodejs.
    - The html2canvas library utilizes Promises and expects them to be available in the global context. 
- https://github.com/johnnywang1994/jsPDF-html2canvas
  - A combine usage with jsPDF & html2canvas, which translating html content to PDF file.

- https://github.com/rsify/pico /ts
  - Pico's goal is to produce high precision screenshots of any viewport entirely client side.
  - This is different from simply capturing a webpage using Puppeteer or a similar tool in that the **screenshot taking happens entirely client side**.
  - This program renders whatever is displayed in the given `Window` into an image, thanks to svg's `<foreignObject>`.
  - **No server side code is required to produce the screenshot**.
  - Pico's selling point is representing the whole viewport as accurately as possible. If you want to render a single DOM node instead, consider using one of the above libraries.
  - Pico is built using Fluture and in addition to the Promise also provides a direct API to Fluture via functions suffixed with Fluture

- https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image /540Star/MIT/202101/ts
  - Generates an image from a DOM node using HTML5 canvas and SVG.
  - Fork from `dom-to-image` with more maintainable code and some new features.

- https://github.com/1904labs/dom-to-image-more /js
  - a library which can turn arbitrary DOM node, including same origin and blob iframes, into a vector (SVG) or raster (PNG or JPEG) image, written in JavaScript.
  - Anatolii's version was based on domvas by Paul Bakaus and has been completely rewritten
  - This fork of `dom-to-image`

- https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image /7kStar/201706/inactive
  - turn arbitrary DOM node into a vector (SVG) or raster (PNG or JPEG) image, written in JavaScript.
  - It's based on domvas
- https://github.com/pbakaus/domvas /370Star/201307
  - Domvas implements the missing piece that connects the DOM and Canvas.
  - It gives to the ability to take arbitrary DOM content and paint it to a Canvas of your choice.
  - Domvas uses a feature of SVG that allows you to embed XHTML content into the SVG 
  - the actual SVG can be used as a data uri, and therefore behaves like a standard image.
  - I brought CSS transforms to browsers that did not have them.
    - HTML content needs to be serialized to XML, and all styles have to be inlined.
  - The DOM object is not linked, but copied 
  - Content outside the bounding box of the element will be cut of per default if painted to Canvas. Don't worry though, simply pass a more comfortable offset to the toImage function

- https://github.com/cburgmer/rasterizeHTML.js /js
  - http://cburgmer.github.io/rasterizeHTML.js
  - Renders HTML into the browser's canvas
  - it is possible by embedding the HTML into an SVG image as a `<foreignObject>` and then drawing the resulting image via `ctx.drawImage()`.
  - SVG is not allowed to link to external resources and so rasterizeHTML.js will load external images, fonts and stylesheets and store them inline via data: URIs (or inline style elements respectively).
