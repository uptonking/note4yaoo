  - InfluxDB is an open source time series database written in Rust, using Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, and Apache DataFusion
  - This latest version (3.x) of InfluxDB focuses on providing a real-time buffer for observational data of all kinds (metrics, events, logs, traces, etc.) that is queryable via SQL or InfluxQL
  - Flux is the custom scripting and query language we developed as part of our effort on InfluxDB 2.0. it is noticeably absent from the description of InfluxDB 3.0.
  - For InfluxDB 3.0 we adopted Apache Arrow DataFusion, an existing query parser, planner, and executor as our core engine. 
  - With InfluxDB 3.0 being a ground-up rewrite of the database in a new language (from Go to Rust), we werenâ€™t able to bring the Flux implementation along.
