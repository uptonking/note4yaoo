  - Polars is a blazingly fast DataFrames library implemented in Rust using Apache Arrow Columnar Format as the memory model.
  - multi-threaded, hybrid-streaming DataFrame library in Rust | Python | Node.js
  - If you have data that does not fit into memory, polars lazy is able to process your query (or parts of your query) in a streaming fashion
  - In the TPCH benchmarks polars is orders of magnitudes faster than pandas, dask, modin and vaex on full queries (including IO).
