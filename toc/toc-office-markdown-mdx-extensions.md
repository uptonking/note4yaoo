# toc-office-markdown-mdx-extensions

- ref
  - search: markdown plugin, md table, md electron, 缺点/mistakes
  - mdx: live edit, md in js, md superset
    - web components in md, mdx web components
  - 推广mdx的公司：gatsby、nextjs、storybook
  - I'm not an expert in JSX or MDX, but looking at the code example I would think MDX could also handle Web Components.

# mdx

  - https://mdxjs.com/
  - /9.7kStar/MIT/202009
  - let you seamlessly use JSX in your markdown documents

    - Compiling the MDX syntax (markdown + JSX) to JavaScript
    - Making it easier to use the MDX syntax in different places

# md-web-components/mdjs

- https://github.com/modernweb-dev/rocket
  - https://rocket.modern-web.dev/
  - /7Star/MIT/202101
  - The modern web setup for static sites with a sprinkle of JavaScript
  - Build on top of giants like eleventy, Rollup, and Modern Web.
  - Small: No overblown tools or frontend frameworks, add JavaScript and/or Web Components only on pages where needed
  - Our goal is to provide developers with a meta framework for static websites with a sprinkle of JavaScript.
- https://github.com/open-wc/mdjs-viewer
  - Markdown JavaScript Viewer Chrome Extension
- https://github.com/zerodevx/zero-md
  - https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/
  - A native markdown-to-html web component based on Custom Elements V1 specs to load and display an external MD file.
  - Under the hood, it uses Marked for super-fast markdown transformation, and Prism for feature-packed syntax highlighting - automagically rendering into its own self-contained shadow DOM container

 

- https://github.com/Matsuuu/stoxy
  - Stoxy is a state management API equipped with Web Components for ease of use.
  - Stoxy is a Web Component based storage/state management tool
  - Stoxy allows you to easily handle, persist and update data in your DOM without the weight of a framework.
  - Stoxy stores the data in a in-browser Database called IndexedDB, only keeping the latest 5 accessed objects in-memory for faster access.
  - Stoxy utilizes a promise-based use flow making it really easy to asynchronously read and write from the storage.
  - If no indexeddb, Stoxy recognizes these cases automatically, and opts out of using it and utilizes a in-memory system only.

# md-extensions

- https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid
  - http://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/
  - Generation of diagram and flowchart from text in a similar manner as markdown

- https://github.com/storybookjs/marksy
  - A markdown to custom components library.

- https://github.com/michael-klein/htmdx
  - This library is an attempt to provide a runtime to compile mdx-like markdown files (with the goal to support full JSX inside of markdown) using htm + marked that is much smaller in file-size as opposed to the official runtime
- https://github.com/wallapatta/wallapatta
  - Wallapatta is like Markdown, but has a layout inspired by handouts of Edward R. Tufte
