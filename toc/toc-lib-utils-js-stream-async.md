# guide

- async-sync (push/pull)
  - event/stream/observable/iterator 可作为统一async/sync的思路
  - 模式的选型会影响整个codebase的代码风格
  - 主流库的实现大多基于Promise/async/await，而不是generator

- queue vs setInterval/loop
  - queue内置更多功能，如pause/resume, FIFO顺序
  - 是否需要传输数据，event更容易传输数据
  - queue需要task的fn提前定义，动态add-task的复杂度高，但动态add-task的场景本身就复杂相关业务也复杂
  - 执行的优先级不同
    - setInterval作为macroTask执行fn的时机是下一个event-loop
    - queue如果使用同步方式实现，执行fn的时机是当前event-loop

- queue-features
  - pause/resume
  - concurrency
  - priority
  - persistence
  - dependence

- https://github.com/EloquentStudio/StreamTable.js /201604/js
  - streams data for tables in the background, updates and renders them using templating frameworks like Mustache.js, HandleBars.js
  - The idea behind StreamTable.js is to initially populate minimum rows (maybe 10 or 20) and after that it streams data silently in the background and update the table.
- https://github.com/EloquentStudio/filter.js /201802/js
  - http://eloquentstudio.github.io/filter.js/
  - Complete solution for client side filtering and rendering using JSON data
  - client-side JSON objects filter which can render html elements. 
  - Multiple filter criteria can be specified and used in conjunction with each other.

- https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js /js
  - the solution to saving streams in the web browser. 
  - It is perfect for web apps where there's a need to save large amounts of data on devices with e.g. limited RAM.
  - there is this new native way to save files to the HD:
    - https://github.com/whatwg/fs
  - I also built native-file-system-adapter so you can have it in all Browsers, Deno, and NodeJS with different storages
    - https://github.com/jimmywarting/native-file-system-adapter

- https://github.com/Kanaries/web-data-loader /ts
  - allows you to load large data files in browser. 
  - It supports stream data and runs in webworker which will not block the main thread while loading the data. 
  - web-data-loader also support stream data sampling, it now support Reservoir Sampling methods.

- https://github.com/jahewson/node-byline
  - Line-by-line Stream reader for node.js

- https://github.com/Claviz/bellboy /202305/ts
  - Highly performant JavaScript data stream ETL engine.
  - Bellboy streams input data row by row. Every row, in turn, goes through user-defined function where it can be transformed.
  - When enough data is collected in batch, it is being loaded to destination.
  - A job in bellboy is a relationship link between processor and destinations
  - Each processor in bellboy is a class which has a single responsibility of processing data of specific type
  - Every job can have as many destinations (outputs) as needed. For example, one job can load processed data into a database, log this data to stdout and post it by HTTP simultaneously.
  - New processors and destinations can be made by extending existing ones.

- https://github.com/vweevers/detect-tabular /js
  - A stream that detects tabular data (spreadsheets, dsv or json) and yields objects.

- https://github.com/finos/regular-table /js/NoDeps
  - A Javascript library for the browser, regular-table exports a custom element named `<regular-table>`, which renders a regular HTML `<table>` to a sticky position within a scrollable viewport. 
  - Only visible cells are rendered and queried from a natively async virtual data model, making regular-table ideal for enormous or remote data sets
  - Use it to build Data Grids, Spreadsheets, Pivot Tables, File Trees
  - Virtual Data Model
    - a simple data model, a two dimensional Array
    - even for very small data sets, regular-table won't read your entire dataset at once. 
    - Instead, we'll need to write a simple virtual data model to access DATA and COLUMN_NAMES indirectly
    - With an async data model, it's easy to serve getDataSlice() remotely from node.js or re-implement the JSON response protocol in any language. 
  - Because of the structure of the HTML `<table>` element,  `<td>` elements must be aligned with their respective row/column, which causes default `<regular-table>` to only be able to scroll in increments of a cell, which can be irregular when column data is of different lengths. 
  - regular-table is natively compatible with `perspective`, a WebAssembly streaming visualization engine. 
    - https://github.com/finos/perspective

- https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore /js
  - Hypercore is a secure, distributed append-only log.
  - Built for sharing large datasets and streams of real time data

- https://github.com/TomerAberbach/lfi /apache2/202308/ts
  - A lazy functional iteration library supporting sync, async, and concurrent iteration
  - Lazy: delays applying operations until their results are needed
  - Functional: provides highly composable functions
  - Iteration: supports sync iterables, async iterables, and unique concurrent iterables
  - https://github.com/loganfsmyth/gensync /202010/js
    - This module allows for developers to write common code that can share implementation details, hiding whether an underlying request happens synchronously or asynchronously. 
    - This is in contrast with many current Node APIs which explicitly implement the same API twice, once with calls to synchronous functions, and once with asynchronous functions.

- https://github.com/graphicore/obtainJS /201604/js
  - Framework to unify synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript.

- https://github.com/web-infra-dev/unport /MIT/202407/ts/还可参考openrpc
  - A Universal Port with strict type inference capability for cross-JSContext communication.
  - Unport emerges as a well-architected solution, meticulously designed to simplify the complexity revolving around various JSContext environments.
    - Node.js, ChildProcess, Webview, Web Worker, worker_threads, WebSocket, iframe, MessageChannel, ServiceWorker, and much more.
  - Each of these JSContext environments exhibits distinct methods of communicating with the external world
    - the lack of defined types can make handling the code for complex projects an arduous task.
  - You only need to define the message types (MessageDefinition) and Intermediate communication channel (Channel) that different JSContexts need to pass, and you will get a unified type of Port
    - a MessageDefinition is a crucial concept that defines the structure of the messages that can be sent and received through a Channel.
    - a Channel is a fundamental concept that represents a Intermediate communication pathway between different JavaScript contexts
  - unrpc: Starting with the 0.6.0 release, we are experimentally introducing support for Typed RPC

  - BFJ implements asynchronous functions and uses pre-allocated fixed-length arrays to try and alleviate those issues.
  - Is it fast?
    - No. BFJ yields frequently to avoid monopolising the event loop, interrupting its own execution to let other event handlers run. The frequency of those yields can be controlled with the yieldRate option, but fundamentally it is not designed for speed.

  - it is supposed that you implement your own nodes
- https://github.com/fibo/flow-view
  - a visual editor for Dataflow programming
  - Nodes and edges can be created via API

- https://github.com/lukehutch/tiny-reactive-dataflow /202210/js
  - A tiny reactive dataflow library for asynchronously scheduling a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of functions in Javascript.
  - works similarly to React's state change propagation algorithm; 
  - All computation is fundamentally DAG-structured, consisting of **edges**, which are data dependencies between values, and **nodes**, representing both a function and the result of computing that function on specific inputs to produce the value at the node.
  - Dependencies are specified using a "pull model" (a function depends upon, or pulls from, its parameters), but computation is driven using a "push model", with changes propagating from upstream nodes to downstream nodes.
  - Create all dataflow nodes as (optionally async) functions, or as "named lambdas", and register them
    - Function names are used as node names. 
    - Function parameter names refer to the node names of upstream dependencies.

- https://github.com/glebec/batching-toposort /201903/js/NoDeps
  - Efficiently sort interdependent tasks into a sequence of concurrently-executable batches.
  - Errors on cyclic graphs
    - Batching-Toposort expects a directed acyclic graph (DAG) implemented via **adjacency list**. 
    - In other words, construct an object whose keys are dependency IDs, and whose values are lists of dependent IDs.
  - Motivation
    - Often one needs to schedule interdependent tasks. 
    - In order to determine task order, the classic solution is to use topological sort. 
    - However, toposort typically outputs a list of individual tasks, without grouping those that can be executed concurrently. 
    - Batching-Toposort takes this additional consideration into account, producing a list of lists of tasks. 
    - The outer list is ordered; each inner list is unordered.

- https://github.com/datavis-tech/topologica /201811/js
  - Minimal library for reactive dataflow programming. 
  - Based on topological sort.
  - Topologica is primarily intended for use in optimizing interactive data visualizations created using D3.js and a unidirectional data flow approach. 
    - The problem with using unidirectional data flow with interactive data visualizations is that it leads to unnecessary execution of heavyweight computations over data on every render. 
    - Topologica.js lets you improve performance by only executing heavy computation and rendering operations when they are actually required.
    - It also allows you to simplify your code by splitting it into logical chunks based on reactive functions, and makes it so you don't need to think about order of execution at all.
  - Why use topological sorting? To avoid inconsistent state.
    - propagation using breadth-first search would cause e to be set twice, and the first time it would be set with an inconsistent state

  - https://reverb-app.github.io/
  - Reverb is an event-driven, asynchronous workflow engine that orchestrates the logic and infrastructure developers need to build complex background tasks. 
  - Users define tasks as multi-step functions in their repository, and Reverb handles triggering and executing them step-by-step. 
    - The service is self-hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is deployable with one command using our CLI tool
  - 🏘️ Reverb’s functionality is organized in a three-node pattern. 
    - The three nodes are the Ingress Server, the Graphile Workers Server and the Functions Server.
    - Ingress Server provides API endpoints for enqueueing your application's Reverb triggers, including events and webhooks. It also provides an endpoint for retrieving logs related to your events and workflows
    - Graphile Workers Server hosts Graphile Worker runners that are responsible for managing your Postgres job queue and processing your application's Reverb workflows. These include jobs triggered by events, cron, or steps within the Reverb step functions you've defined
    - Functions Server hosts your application's Reverb workflow definitions and contains all the code needed to create these jobs from the provided template.
    - A function can be a single function invocation or can consist of multiple steps**._ Each step will need to be awaited._**
    - Steps can run code, delay execution, invoke another workflow, or emit an event.

  - GraphAI is an asynchronous data flow execution engine, which allows developers to build agentic applications by describing agent workflows as declarative data flow graphs in YAML or JSON.
  - agentic applications require making multiple asynchronous API calls (e.g., OpenAI's chat-completion API, database queries, web searches) and managing data dependencies among them
  - GraphAI allows developers to describe dependencies among those agents (asynchronous API calls) in a data flow graph in YAML or JSON, which is called declarative data flow programming

## async-sync-converter

- https://github.com/thefrontside/effection /MIT/202409/ts
  - https://frontside.com/effection
  - Structured concurrency and effects for JavaScript
  - Effection leverages the idea of structured concurrency to ensure that you don't leak any resources, effects, and that cancellation is always properly handled. 
  - It helps you build concurrent code that feels rock solid at scale, and it does all of this while feeling like normal JavaScript.
  - Effection runs on all major JavaScript platforms including NodeJs, Browser, and Deno.
  - Unlike Promises and async/await, Effection is fundamentally synchronous in nature, which means you have full control over the event loop and operations requiring synchronous setup remain race condition free.
  - 👉 For every Async/Await/Promise API we provide Structured Concurrency compliant Effection alternative.
  - [Announcing Effection 3.0 -- Structured Concurrency and Effects for JavaScript _202311](https://frontside.com/blog/2023-12-18-announcing-effection-v3/)
    - This new version refines and simplifies the abstractions we first created in version 2.0 while introducing some new ones of exceptional power.

    - Rebuilt with Delimited Continuations

- https://github.com/dmaevsky/conclure /MIT/202211/js/NoDeps/inactive
  - Brings cancellation and testability to your async flows.
  - It is a tiny (core is < 200 lines of code), zero dependencies generator runner. 
  - Using generators instead of promises allows for a LOT more flexibility, including cancellation, sync resolution, and better testing. The API is strictly the same as `async/await`.
  - 🤼 You should avoid Promises for two major reasons:
    - Promises are greedy: once created, cannot be cancelled
    - `await promise` always inserts a tick into your async flow, even if the promise is already resolved or can be resolved synchronously.
  - You can see a Promise as a particular type of an iterator for which the JS VM provides a built-in runner, a quite poorly designed one nonetheless.
  - Conclure JS is a custom generator runner that
    - allows you to cancel your async flows
    - ensures that sync flows always resolve synchronously
    - delivers better testability through the use of effects as popularized by redux-saga.

- https://github.com/debezium/debezium /java
  - https://debezium.io/
  - provides a low latency data streaming platform for change data capture (CDC). 
  - You set up and configure Debezium to monitor your databases, and then your applications consume events for each row-level change made to the database. 
  - Only committed changes are visible
  - since Debezium records the history of data changes in durable, replicated logs, your application can be stopped and restarted at any time, and it will be able to consume all of the events it missed while it was not running
  - Monitoring databases and being notified when data changes has always been complicated. 
    - Relational database triggers can be useful, but are specific to each database
    - Debezium provides modules that do this work for you. 
    - Some modules are generic and work with multiple database management systems
    - Other modules are tailored for specific database management systems
