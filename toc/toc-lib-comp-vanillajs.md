  - Tom Select is a dynamic, framework agnostic, and lightweight (~16kb gzipped) `<select>` UI control.
  - Tom Select was forked from `selectize.js` with the goal of modernizing the code base, decoupling from jQuery, and expanding functionality.
  - Options are efficiently scored and sorted on-the-fly (using sifter).

  - JavaScript library for building autocomplete experiences.
  - The data that populates the autocomplete results are called sources. 
  - You can use whatever you want in your sources: a static set of searches terms, search results from an external source like an Algolia index, recent searches, and more.
  - The library creates an input and provides the interactivity and accessibility attributes, but you’re in full control of the DOM elements to output.
  - Unlike InstantSearch, Autocomplete doesn’t provide a library of ready-made UI widgets
