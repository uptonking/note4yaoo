  - mysql， ✅ 可替换为sqlite
  - 实现清晰简单

  - 操作数据库混合使用了 gorm 和 sqlx, 只有一张表使用了sqlx

  - sqlite + wire

  - Golang Hexagonal Architecture codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the RealWorld spec and API.
  - The hexagonal architecture is simply push any external dependency to the edge of the app and keep business logic (service) in the core part. With this architecture we can easily swap external dependencies such as swap restful API to gRPC, mongo to postgres etc.

- https://github.com/AngusGMorrison/realworld-go /MIT/202310/go/sqlite/inactive
  - Hexgonally Architected, Production-Ready, Golang Modular Monolith Example App
  - The example uses JSON over HTTP as its transport layer and SQLite as its datastore, but our business logic doesn't care. If we moved to gRPC and MongoDB, nothing in the business logic would need to change.

  - built with Gin and the Ent framework
