- open source alternatives

- https://github.com/chinchang/web-maker
  - https://webmaker.app/
  - an offline playground for your web experiments. 
  - Something like CodePen or JSFiddle, but much more faster and offline supported because it runs completely on your system.

  - an interactive coding playground for VS Code
  - It's like having the magic of a traditional web playground (e.g. CodePen, JSFiddle), but available directly from your highly-personalized editor

- https://github.com/chr15m/slingcode /MIT/202008/clojure/inactive
  - https://slingcode.net/
  - Slingcode is a personal computing platform in a single html file.
  - You don't need a server, hosting, or an SSL certificate to run the web apps.
  - You can share apps peer-to-peer over WebTorrent.

## CodeSandbox

- http://codesandbox.io/
- CodeSandbox is an online editor that allows developers to focus on writing code while it handles all the necessary background processes and configurations. 
- Unlike CodePen, CodeSandbox focuses more on building and sharing code demos that contain back-end components. 
- The editor is optimized to analyze npm dependencies, show custom error messages, and also make projects searchable by npm dependency.
- It is worthy to note that CodeSandbox is one of the few online playgrounds that has support for back-end languages like Node.js. 
  - It has npm support. 
  - As a result of it, you can install any npm package you require in seconds.

## StackBlitz

- https://stackblitz.com/
- StackBlitz is a VSCode powered online playground for web developers. 
- Thanks to StackBlitz in-browser development server, you can continue writing code and editing your work even when offline. 
  - This gives you the superpower to build offline while leveraging the power of the online platform

## JSFiddle

- https://jsfiddle.net/
- It is one of the earliest playgrounds that laid the foundation for the creation of other modern-day playgrounds. 
- At the moment, it may seem a bit basic compared to modern playgrounds like CodePen

## JSBin

- https://jsbin.com/
- JSBin is a live playground for Html, CSS and JavaScript and a range of other preprocessors like jade, markdown and much more.
- JSBin is mostly focused on the ability to share code.

- In-video interaction
  - Scrimba lets you take up an instructors demo and build it up into whatever use case you desire. 
  - In the playground mode, you can interact with the instructor's code however you please, 
  - and you can edit, copy, paste and basically perform any interactive operation you desire.
