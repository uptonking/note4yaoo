  - A source code text editor that renders in an HTML5 canvas. 
  - useful for texturing 3D objects in WebGL apps.
  - Primrose is a syntax highlighting text editor that renders into an HTML5 Canvas element. 
    - This is particularly useful for texturing 3D objects in WebGL apps.
    - Here is a basic example that creates an editor in a 2D web page.
    - Here is a basic example that creates an editor in a 3D WebGL app, using Three.js.
  - While Primrose can manage most input events on its own, in WebGL contexts, it's not able to figure out what the user's pointer is pointing at. 
  - Grammars are collections of RegExps that define rules for performing the necessary tokenization to be able to achieve syntax highlighting.

  - A proof of concept text editor implemented with HTML5 Canvas
  - Currently this editor uses an array of **Gap Buffer**s to represent and manipulate the file data. 
  - Internal benchmarks show it is more performant than a javascript simple array or another implementation of Gap Buffer using javascript Typed Arrays.

# custom-layout
- https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy /201509/js/inactive
  - Ritzy editor is a rich text, real-time character-by-character collaborative embeddable browser-based editor. 
  - It shuns(避免) use of the `contentEditable` attribute in favor of a custom editor surface and layout engine, exactly like the approach implemented by Google Docs.
  - Ritzy is built with real-time collaborative editing support from the ground up, underlying mechanism for this is a causal tree CRDT.

- https://github.com/youtube/cobalt /BSD/202501/cpp
  - https://cobalt.dev/
  - https://developers.google.com/youtube/cobalt
  - Cobalt is a lightweight HTML5/CSS/JS application container that is designed to provide a rich application development environment with minimal resource consumption (deployment size, RAM, CPU, GPU). 
  - 为在极少资源条件下播放视频而设计，支持audio/video标签，不支持img/p，对文本排版支持有限
  - Cobalt is a single-process application and does not rely on the ability to spawn multiple processes.
  - Cobalt is optimized to run on single-core CPUs, resulting in better input latency since the renderer and resource loader do not compete with layout operations.
  - Cobalt produces consistent 60FPS animations by only supporting animation of properties that don't affect layout, like transform, and always running animations on a separate thread.
  - On platforms that support GLES2, Cobalt avoids CPU painting by performing almost all rendering operations on the GPU.
