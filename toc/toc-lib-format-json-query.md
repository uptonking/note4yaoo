- ## [Add consideration to JSON Pointer and JSON Path](https://github.com/opengeospatial/architecture-dwg/issues/15)
- JSON pointer
  - This specification defines JSON Pointer, a string syntax for identifying a specific value within a JSON document. 
  - JSON Pointer is intended to be easily expressed in JSON string values as well as URI fragment identifiers.
  - `/foo/0` single value

- JSON path
  - Like XMLPath.
  - More expresive
  - Not an standard
  - `['foo'][0]` single value
  - `$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title` multi value

  - lightweight API to query Javascript arrays using MongoDB syntax in the browser and Node.js.
  - This module originated as a proprietary module for Protobi core, implementing MongoDB syntax for Javascript data arrays.
  - This API matches much of underscore-query's documentation, and the code passes most of unit tests in the `underscore-query` module.

  - It allows you to use methods such as schema, innerJoin, where, limit, select, orderBy on JSON data.

# discuss
- ## [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer (2013) | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35545384)
- I was wondering how this differs from JSONPath
  - jsonpointer just defines how to access to a single value inside a json document, whereas jsonpath has more powerful features like union (extract multiple values), filters and deep search (recursively match a path).
  - jsonpath is missing a proper specification, so some behaviors are implementation specific with some parts heavily depending on some javascript constructs (mainly filters).

- JSON Pointer is just not powerful enough except for the simplest use cases. I very much prefer JSON Path.

- ## [Interesting that they're using JSONPath, which isn't even specified formally anywhere... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13093607)
- The only other major implementor that I know about is Kubernetes, which has some odd extensions for templating. (JSONPath itself, of course, isn't very well designed in the first place.)
- ðŸ’¡ Perhaps the most formally specified JSON-addressing dense declarative syntax is JSON Pointer (RFC 6901), but it's very limited: 
  - it only has exact index selectors, an end-of-array selector, and an exact object name selector. 
  - Still, given how JSON-Patch (RFC 6902) depends on it, it may be worthwhile to pursue a notation that extends it formally.
- IBM JSONata is another open source alternative. 
  - seems like a good alternative to XPath

- ## [Jsonpath â€“ a query language for JSON in Postgres [pdf] | Hacker News_201905](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19949240)
- Also of interest is RFC 6901, JSON Pointer 
  - That spec is much simpler (and syntactically incompatible, I may add), providing unique paths to elements inside a JSON document, and not handling any sorts of queries, as these Jsonpath and JSONPath things both do.
- JSON Pointer is not ubiquitous by any means, but it does got use in diverse APIs. Most recently, JMAP uses it for backreferences.

- another alternative is jsonata, backed by IBM
