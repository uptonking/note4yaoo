  - Enlightened library to convert HTML and CSS to SVG
  - ✨ 提供了支持可视化配置的playground
  - What if there’s a `<Satori>` component that adds fluid layout & style transitions to your elements?
  - https://github.com/natemoo-re/satori-html
    - satori is built on top of React's JSX and expects "React-elements-like objects".

# examples
- https://github.com/whiteSHADOW1234/MergeSVG /MIT/202510/ts
  - https://mergesvg.vercel.app/
  - Combine SVGs like a designer: free-form drag & drop, pixel-perfect alignment, deep styling, and one-click merge.
  - README’s limited Markdown makes it hard to get banner layouts to look exactly the way I want. So I built MergeSVG: a browser-based, drag-and-drop tool that merges SVGs into a single, self-contained file and lets you position, resize and style graphics visually.
  - Customizable canvas background — Control background color, transparency, and patterns (grid, dots, checkerboard).
  - Real-time preview — See your composition as you build it.
  - Client-side processing — Fast, secure, and private—everything runs in your browser.
  - No more broken links — The app embeds raw SVG content into a single file so external resources can’t break your layout.
