  - 依赖marked、prismjs
  - A magical documentation site generator.
  - No statically built html files, Support SSR, Support embedded files
    - there is literally no build step
    - unlike many static generators no HTML static site is created... update the Markdown and the site immediately shows those changes.
  - Useful plugin API, Smart full-text search plugin
  - Docsify is way way easier, probably because all the “build” stuff is happening via the javascript in realtime.

- https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus
  - /19.5kStar/MIT/202010
  - Docusaurus 1 used to be a pure documentation site generator. 
  - In Docusaurus 2, we rebuilt it from the ground up, allowing for more customizability 
    - but preserved the best parts of Docusaurus 1 - easy to get started, versioned docs, and i18n
    - While our main focus will still be helping you get your documentations right and well, 
    - it is possible to build any kind of website using Docusaurus 2 as it is just a React application. 
    - Docusaurus can now be used to build any website, not just documentation websites.
  - Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. 
    - GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby
  - Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.
  - In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using `<script />` tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps.

- [Storybook vs Styleguidist_201805](https://www.chromatic.com/blog/storybook-vs-styleguidist/)
- [What’s the difference between Styleguidist and Storybook?](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/cookbook/#are-there-any-other-projects-like-this)
  - For me, the biggest distinction is how you describe component variations.
    - With Storybook you write stories in JavaScript files
    - with Styleguidist you write examples in Markdown files
  - Another important distinction is that Storybook shows only one variation of one component at a time 
    - but Styleguidist can show all variations of all components, all variations of a single component or one variation. 
  - It’s easier to create a style guide with Styleguidist 
    - but Storybook has more tools to develop components
