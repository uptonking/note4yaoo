  - A CST, or Concrete Syntax Tree, is a way of representing a computer program that captures its source text and semantic structure simultaneously.
  - cst-tokens; Its CSTs are ASTs where each node has a `node.cstTokens` array of `{type, value}` tokens. 
  - To make the AST we threw away all the textual symbols that humans use to read programs: the blank space, the braces, the comments. 
  - code editing tools need a useful, standard way of incorporating spaces, braces, and comments into an Abstract Syntax Tree, thus turning it into a Conrete Syntax Tree or CST.
