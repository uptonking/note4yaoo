- https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer /BSD/202503/ts
  - https://godbolt.org/
  - Run compilers interactively from your web browser and interact with the assembly
  - Edit code in C, C++, C#, F#, Rust, Go, D, Haskell, Swift, Pascal, ispc, Python, Java, or any of the other 30+ supported languages components, and see how that code looks after being compiled in real time.
  - Compiler Explorer is written in TypeScript, on Node.js.
  - Multiple compilers are supported for each language, many different tools and visualizations are available, and the UI layout is configurable (thanks to `GoldenLayout`).

  - Lightweight approach to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string.

  - A CST, or Concrete Syntax Tree, is a way of representing a computer program that captures its source text and semantic structure simultaneously.
  - cst-tokens; Its CSTs are ASTs where each node has a `node.cstTokens` array of `{type, value}` tokens. 
  - To make the AST we threw away all the textual symbols that humans use to read programs: the blank space, the braces, the comments. 
  - code editing tools need a useful, standard way of incorporating spaces, braces, and comments into an Abstract Syntax Tree, thus turning it into a Conrete Syntax Tree or CST.

- [Flattening ASTs (and Other Compiler Data Structures)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/blog/flattening.html)
  - On storing ASTs in flat arrays for performance, and the relationship with bytecode interpreters
  - Flattening uses an arena that only holds one type, so it’s actually just a plain array
  - We’ll focus here on flattening abstract syntax trees (ASTs), but the idea applies to any pointer-laden data structure.
  - we’ll build a basic interpreter twice: first the normal way and then the flat way
