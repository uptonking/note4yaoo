  - This project resolves a full set of movies from TMDB and IMDB in batches, storing them into a Postgres database using Prisma.
  - This includes difficult-to-access data like IMDB ratings, Rotten Tomatoes audience & critic scores, and YouTube trailers.
  - Everything is handled including data fetching, normalization, cleaning, and filtering.
