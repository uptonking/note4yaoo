- scheduler
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/scheduler
  - a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment. 
  - It is currently used internally by React, but we plan to make it more generic.

- https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid
  - Collision-resistant ids optimized for horizontal scaling and binary search lookup performance.
  - Most pseudo-random algorithms use time in ms as a random seed. 
    - Application developers report v4 UUID collisions causing problems in their applications when the ID generation is distributed between lots of machines such that lots of IDs are generated in the same millisecond.
  - Cuid already works standalone in browsers, or as a node module
  - Cuids generated by the same process are monotonically increasing, when less than 10000 cuids are generated within the same millisecond. 
    - Generated by different processes, the cuids will still have an increasing value in time if the process clocks are synchronized.
    - Monotonically increasing IDs are suitable for use as high-performance database primary keys, because they can be binary searched. 
    - Pure pseudo-random variants don't meet this requirement.
