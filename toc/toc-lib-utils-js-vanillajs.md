- scheduler
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/scheduler
  - a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment. 
  - It is currently used internally by React, but we plan to make it more generic.

- https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid
  - Collision-resistant ids optimized for horizontal scaling and binary search lookup performance.
  - Most pseudo-random algorithms use time in ms as a random seed. 
    - Application developers report v4 UUID collisions causing problems in their applications when the ID generation is distributed between lots of machines such that lots of IDs are generated in the same millisecond.
  - Cuid already works standalone in browsers, or as a node module
  - Cuids generated by the same process are monotonically increasing, when less than 10000 cuids are generated within the same millisecond. 
    - Generated by different processes, the cuids will still have an increasing value in time if the process clocks are synchronized.
    - Monotonically increasing IDs are suitable for use as high-performance database primary keys, because they can be binary searched. 
    - Pure pseudo-random variants don't meet this requirement.
# ioc

  - Dependency injection for ES6 classes
  - api风格未使用decorator
# dev-testing
- https://github.com/blakeembrey/change-case
  - Transform a string between camelCase, PascalCase, Capital Case, snake_case, param-case, CONSTANT_CASE, dot.case, Header-Case, no case, path/case, Sentence case and others.

- https://github.com/pgte/konphyg

# date-time
- https://github.com/dmtrKovalenko/date-io
  - Abstraction over common JavaScript date management libraries.
  - exposes an abstraction interface over luxon, date-fns v2, dayjs and moment.
# command-line
- https://github.com/fabiospampinato/tiny-parse-argv
  - A tiny function for parsing `process.argv`.
  - a modern rewrite of a sensible subset of minimist.
# serialization
- https://github.com/bufbuild/connect-es
  - Type-safe APIs with Protobuf and TypeScript.
  - Connect is a family of libraries for building and consuming APIs on different languages and platforms.
  - Unlike REST, the RPCs you use with Connect are typesafe end to end, but they are regular HTTP under the hood
# binary/buffer
- https://github.com/hazae41/binary /ts/NoDeps
  - Zero-copy binary data types

- https://github.com/superman2211/xobj
  - Decoding and encoding JavaScript/TypeScript objects to binary format.

- https://github.com/zandaqo/structurae
  - A collection of data structures for high-performance JavaScript applications 
  - simple binary protocol based on DataView and defined with JSONSchema
  - making web apps using an objects backed by TypedArrays for much less memory allocation.

- https://github.com/rvagg/bl
  - bl is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. 
  - Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!
# MV**-framework
- https://github.com/smalllong/lightue /js
  - https://lightue.netlify.app/
  - A lightweight and simple model-view framework inspired by Vue.js
  - https://github.com/smalllong/lightuepress
# render
- https://github.com/arthurhovhannisyan31/offscreen-canvas-worker
  - Application allows to fetch and process data in the background using workers api.
  - This applications does data fetching and processing in the background with submission of final result to main app.
# iframe
- https://github.com/krakenjs/zoid
  - Cross domain components
  - Render an iframe or popup on a different domain, and pass down props, including objects and functions
# lang-typescript
- https://github.com/remeda/remeda
  - The first "data-first" and "data-last" utility library designed especially for TypeScript.
  - Remeda is written and tested in TypeScript and that means there won't be any problems with custom typings.
  - "data-first" approach is more natural and more programmer friendly for pick/omit
  - "data-last" approach is helpful when writing data transformations aka pipes.
# lang-js
- https://github.com/kriskowal/asap /js
  - High-priority task queue for Node.js and browsers
  - The library asap uses these tricks to provide a cross-browser way of queueing a microtask.
  - Promise and asynchronous observer libraries, as well as hand-rolled callback programs and libraries, often need a mechanism to postpone the execution of a callback until the next available event. 

- https://github.com/bestiejs/benchmark.js
  - A robust benchmarking library that supports high-resolution timers & returns statistically significant results. 
  - As used on jsPerf.com.

- https://github.com/niksy/node-stdlib-browser
  - Node standard library for browser.
  - Based on `node-libs-browser` for Webpack

- https://github.com/humphd/browser-shell
  - A Linux command-line shell in the browser
  - A Linux shell in the browser via forked v86, with bi-directional POSIX filesystem (via Filer) shared over Plan 9 resource sharing.

- browsix /3.1kStar/MIT/201904/ts/inactive
  - https://github.com/plasma-umass/browsix
  - Browsix is a Unix-like operating system for the browser.
  - outdated. requires node 6 (latest is node 19)
  - Browsix uses `BrowserFS` for its filesystem
  - Browsix makes core Unix features available to web applications (including pipes, processes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system) and extends JavaScript runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js programs so they can run in a Unix-like environment within the browser. 
  - Browsix also provides a POSIX-like shell that makes it easy to compose applications together for parallel data processing via pipes.
  - Browsix enables you to compose the in-browser part of your web applications out of processes. 
    - This process model is implemented on top of existing browser APIs, like web workers, so it works in all modern browsers.
