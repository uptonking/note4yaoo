- scheduler
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/scheduler
  - a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment. 
  - It is currently used internally by React, but we plan to make it more generic.

- https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid
  - Collision-resistant ids optimized for horizontal scaling and binary search lookup performance.
  - Most pseudo-random algorithms use time in ms as a random seed. 
    - Application developers report v4 UUID collisions causing problems in their applications when the ID generation is distributed between lots of machines such that lots of IDs are generated in the same millisecond.
  - Cuid already works standalone in browsers, or as a node module
  - Cuids generated by the same process are monotonically increasing, when less than 10000 cuids are generated within the same millisecond. 
    - Generated by different processes, the cuids will still have an increasing value in time if the process clocks are synchronized.
    - Monotonically increasing IDs are suitable for use as high-performance database primary keys, because they can be binary searched. 
    - Pure pseudo-random variants don't meet this requirement.

  - Browsix uses `BrowserFS` for its filesystem
  - Browsix makes core Unix features available to web applications (including pipes, processes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system) and extends JavaScript runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js programs so they can run in a Unix-like environment within the browser. 
  - Browsix also provides a POSIX-like shell that makes it easy to compose applications together for parallel data processing via pipes.
  - Browsix enables you to compose the in-browser part of your web applications out of processes. 
    - This process model is implemented on top of existing browser APIs, like web workers, so it works in all modern browsers.

# web-dom
- https://github.com/retentioneering/retentioneering-dom-observer
  - The package contains tools for parsing DOM data, observing DOM and tracking changes.
  - This class is a wrapper over MutationObservers, allowing you to observe changes even of those nodes that are not already in the DOM
  - Observation will automatically start as soon as the target node appends in the DOM.

# vdom
- https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom /js
  - lightweight DOM diffing/patching (no virtual DOM needed)
  - Lightweight module for morphing an existing DOM node tree to match a target DOM node tree. 
  - Instead of replacing the existing DOM tree with a new DOM tree we want to transform the existing DOM tree to match the new DOM tree while minimizing the number of changes to the existing DOM tree. 
  - morphdom does not rely on any virtual DOM abstractions. Because morphdom is using the real DOM, the DOM that the web browser is maintaining will always be the source of truth. 
  - morphdom can be used with any templating language that produces an HTML string.
  - The transformation is done in a single pass of both the original DOM tree and the target DOM tree and is designed to minimize changes to the DOM 
  - the algorithm used by this module will automatically match up elements that have corresponding IDs and that are found in both the original and target DOM tree
  - Support for diffing the real DOM with a virtual DOM was introduced in v2.1.0
  - Both morphdom and virtual DOM based solutions update the real DOM with the minimum number of changes. The only difference is in how the differences are determined. **morphdom compares real DOM nodes while virtual-dom and others only compare virtual DOM nodes**.

- https://github.com/natemoo-re/micromorph /ts
  - A very tiny library for diffing live DOM nodes.
  - With the /nav entrypoint, Micromorph automatically converts your MPA into a SPA while only re-rendering content that has changed.

- https://github.com/google/incremental-dom /ts
  - Incremental DOM is a library for building up DOM trees and updating them in-place when data changes. 
  - 👉🏻 It differs from the established virtual DOM approach in that no intermediate tree is created (the existing tree is mutated in-place). 
  - This approach significantly reduces memory allocation and GC thrashing
  - Incremental DOM is primarily intended as a compilation target for templating languages. 
  - Think of it as ASM.dom
