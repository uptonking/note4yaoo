- scheduler
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/scheduler
  - a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment.

- https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid
  - Collision-resistant ids optimized for horizontal scaling and binary search lookup performance.
  - Most pseudo-random algorithms use time in ms as a random seed. 
    - Application developers report v4 UUID collisions causing problems in their applications when the ID generation is distributed between lots of machines such that lots of IDs are generated in the same millisecond.
  - Cuid already works standalone in browsers, or as a node module
  - Cuids generated by the same process are monotonically increasing, when less than 10000 cuids are generated within the same millisecond. 
    - Generated by different processes, the cuids will still have an increasing value in time if the process clocks are synchronized.
    - Monotonically increasing IDs are suitable for use as high-performance database primary keys, because they can be binary searched. 
    - Pure pseudo-random variants don't meet this requirement.

# vdom
- https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom /js
  - lightweight DOM diffing/patching (no virtual DOM needed)
  - Lightweight module for morphing an existing DOM node tree to match a target DOM node tree. 
  - Instead of replacing the existing DOM tree with a new DOM tree we want to transform the existing DOM tree to match the new DOM tree while minimizing the number of changes to the existing DOM tree. 
  - morphdom does not rely on any virtual DOM abstractions. Because morphdom is using the real DOM, the DOM that the web browser is maintaining will always be the source of truth. 
  - morphdom can be used with any templating language that produces an HTML string.
  - The transformation is done in a single pass of both the original DOM tree and the target DOM tree and is designed to minimize changes to the DOM 
  - the algorithm used by this module will automatically match up elements that have corresponding IDs and that are found in both the original and target DOM tree
  - Support for diffing the real DOM with a virtual DOM was introduced in v2.1.0
  - Both morphdom and virtual DOM based solutions update the real DOM with the minimum number of changes. The only difference is in how the differences are determined. **morphdom compares real DOM nodes while virtual-dom and others only compare virtual DOM nodes**.

- https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph /js
  - a javascript library for morphing one DOM tree to another
  - Both morphdom and nanomorph use the `id` property of a node to match up elements within a given set of sibling nodes. When an id match is found, the existing element is not removed from the DOM, but is instead morphed in place to the new content.
  - However, in both these algorithms, the structure of the children of sibling nodes is not considered when morphing two nodes: only the ids of the nodes are considered. This is due to performance: it is not feasible to recurse through all the children of siblings when matching things up.
  - Idiomorph takes a different approach: before node-matching occurs, both the new content and the old content are processed to create id sets, a mapping of elements to a set of all ids found within that element. Id sets can be computed relatively efficiently via a query selector + a bottom up algorithm.
  - idiomorph 来自于框架 htmx。

  - A very tiny library for diffing live DOM nodes.
  - With the /nav entrypoint, Micromorph automatically converts your MPA into a SPA while only re-rendering content that has changed.

- https://github.com/google/incremental-dom /ts
  - Incremental DOM is a library for building up DOM trees and updating them in-place when data changes. 
  - 👉🏻 It differs from the established virtual DOM approach in that no intermediate tree is created (the existing tree is mutated in-place). 
  - This approach significantly reduces memory allocation and GC thrashing
  - Incremental DOM is primarily intended as a compilation target for templating languages. 
  - Think of it as ASM.dom
