  - Pack tree nodes into a flat object and unpack them again!
  - The original use case is to allow path based trees (such as the one used by Slate) to be stored in NoSQL based storage and be able to update them partially without sending the full tree.
  - Limitations

    - It is assumed that you have children of each node in a single array object
    - Self referencing objects at any point in the tree are not supported
    - An id field is required to perform better change detection (using idKey option).

- https://github.com/PerimeterX/flast
  - Provides a flat Abstract Syntax Tree and an Arborist to trim and modify the tree
  - Adds a unique id to each node to simplify tracking and understanding relations between nodes.
  - Arborist - marks nodes for replacement or deletion and applies all changes in a single iteration over the tree.

- freezer /1.3kStar/MIT/201803/js/NoDeps
  - https://github.com/arqex/freezer
  - A tree data structure that emits events on updates, even if the modification is triggered by one of the leaves, making it easier to think in a reactive way.
  - Immutable trees to make fast comparison among nodes.
  - Eventful nodes to notify updates to other parts of the app.
  - Freezer is inspired by other tree cursor libraries, specifically Cortex, that try to solve an inconvenience of the Flux architecture
    - It creates a new tree every time a modification is required, referencing the non modified nodes from the previous tree. 
    - Sharing node references among frozen objects saves memory and boosts the performance of creating new frozens.

  - This tree is based on top-down splaying algorithm by D. Sleator.
# file-folder-dir-scan-watch
- 文件编辑浏览的实现思路
  - edit > ~~save(内存或本地)~~ > render
  - 文件逐个处理

- `fs.watch(filename[, options][, listener])`.
  - Watch for changes on `filename`, where `filename` is either a file or a directory.
  - The `listener` callback gets two arguments (eventType, filename). `eventType` is either 'rename' or 'change', and `filename` is the name of the file which triggered the event.
  - The `fs.watch` API is not 100% consistent across platforms, and is unavailable in some situations.
  - If the underlying functionality is not available for some reason, then fs.watch() will not be able to function and may thrown an exception. 
  - It is still possible to use `fs.watchFile()`, which uses stat polling, but this method is slower and less reliable.

- `fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener)`.
  - Watch for changes on `filename`. 
  - The callback listener will be called each time the file is accessed.
  - The `listener` gets two arguments the current stat object and the previous stat object(instances of fs. Stat)
  - To be notified when the file was modified, not just accessed, it is necessary to compare `curr.mtime` and `prev.mtime`.
  - `fs.watch()` is more efficient than `fs.watchFile` and fs.unwatchFile

- nodemon 
  - is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
  - [Don’t use nodemon, there are better ways!](https://codeburst.io/dont-use-nodemon-there-are-better-ways-fc016b50b45e)
    - Solution: don’t restart the server
    - use `chokidar` to watch the files
  - I am generally not a fan of nodemon as a workflow for basically this reason. 
    - If I'm in a sandbox usually fine to 'hot load' and run whatever code on save. 
    - If I'm in node, I always want manual control over *what* changes run and *when*.
  - In fact I don't even use nodemon on my machine. 
    - It always leaves zombie processes running on my machine. 
    - I have to kill them manually by looking them up by opened port. 

- https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar
  - file watcher used in MS VSCode.
  - Minimal and efficient cross-platform file watching library
  - On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin `FSEvents` API.
  - On most other platforms, the fs.watch-based implementation is the default, which avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. 
- https://github.com/webpack/watchpack
  - 不依赖chokidar，依赖graceful-fs，由webpack开发
  - watchpack high level API doesn't map directly to watchers. 
  - Instead a three level architecture ensures that for each directory only a single watcher exists.
- https://github.com/Qard/onchange
  - 依赖chokidar
  - Use glob patterns to watch file sets and run a command when anything is added, changed or deleted.
- https://github.com/fabiospampinato/watcher
  - The file system watcher, with no native dependencies and optional rename detection support.
  - Node's built-in `fs.watch` function is garbage and you never want to use it directly.
    - Recursive watching is not supported under Linux
    - the events provided by fs.watch are completely useless as they tell you nothing about what actually happened in the file system
  - `chokidar` requires a native dependency for efficient recursive watching under macOS
  - It doesn't watch recursively efficiently under Windows

  - 依赖chokidar、colors、connect、event-stream、faye-websocket、htp-auth、morgan、opn、proxy-middleware、send、serve-index
    - 不建议使用，推荐使用依赖livereload-js的node-livereload
  - a little development server with live reload capability.
  - Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate dev
  - If you don't want/need the live reload, you should probably use something simpler, like python -m SimpleHTTPServer/http.server 8999
  - https://github.com/geelen/jspm-server
    - It's based on @tapio's excellent live-server
- https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js
  - 无依赖
  - 示例依赖watchify，watchify依赖chokidar
  - To use LiveReload, you need a client (this script) in your browser and a server running on your development machine
  - This repository (livereload.js) implements the client side of the protocol. 
  - The client connects to a LiveReload server via web sockets and listens for incoming change notifications. 
  - It gets change notifications from a LiveReload server and applies them to the browser.
  - If you are developing a LiveReload server, see dist/livereload.js for the latest version built using the sources in this repository. 
  - We require LiveReload server vendors to distribute livereload.js as part of their apps or tools.
- https://github.com/napcs/node-livereload
  - Current maintained fork of LiveReload server in Node.js
  - 依赖 chokidar、livereload-js、ws、opts
  - 注意：文件更新消息的发送，使用的是ws协议，需要在浏览器中访问file:///path/to/test.html，而不是http://localhost:35729/test.html

- https://github.com/mihneadb/node-directory-tree
  - http://livereload.com/
  - Creates a JS object representing a directory tree.
  - const dirTree = require("directory-tree"); 
  - const tree = dirTree("/some/path"); 
- https://github.com/euberdeveloper/dree
  - 只依赖yargs
  - A nodejs module which helps you handle a directory tree. 
  -  It provides you an object of a directory tree with custom configuration and optional callback method when a file or dir is scanned. 
  - const dree = require('dree'); 
  - const tree = dree.scan('./folder', options); 

- https://github.com/jkomyno/pate
  - 依赖glob, yargs, chalk, progress
  - pate is a library that, given a RegExp pattern and a folder path, filters out every nested file in that folder which doesn't match the pattern.
  - Optionally it's possible either to write the list of files that match to a file, to log every single action that's happening internally, or even to filter the files via a glob pattern.
