- datopian-portaljs /2.2kStar/MIT/202509/ts
  - https://github.com/datopian/portaljs
  - https://portaljs.org/
  - a framework for rapidly building rich data portal frontends using a modern frontend approach.
  - 依赖nextjs、ag-grid、tanstack-table、xlsx、material-ui.v4、mui-x-data-grid、react-plotly.js
  - built in Javascript and React on top of the popular Next.js framework. 
  - portal assumes a "decoupled" approach where the frontend is a separate service from the backend and interacts with backend(s) via an API. 
  - It can be used with any backend and has out of the box support for CKAN.
  - Portal.js used to be Recline(JS)

- https://github.com/datopian/frontend-v2
  - Data Portal frontend. Designed for CKAN but usable anywhere. 
  - Microservice architecture so you can run and customize it standalone and connect to your backend of choice.

    - Datasette Lite is Datasette packaged using WebAssembly so that it runs entirely in your browser, no Python web application server required

    - Building a modern Python app using ASGI
    - "My breakthrough was the realization that read-only data packaged as a SQLite database could be deployed to inexpensive serverless hosting"
    - My breakthrough was the realization that any text data packaged as a SQLite database could be deployed to inexpensive serverless hosting. And binary data too
    - For sites that are running in CKAN using the datastore plugin on CSV/tabular resources, there is essentially a sql endpoint to make queries against that data. There are also automated conversions of that data to csv/json/xml. In my experience though, there's not a lot of activity around those apis -- people tend to just download the data.

- https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace /816Star/BSD/202401/java
  - https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/
  - The DSpace digital asset management system that powers your Institutional Repository
  - DSpace consists of both a Java-based backend and an Angular-based frontend.
  - Backend (this codebase) provides a REST API, along with other machine-based interfaces (e.g. OAI-PMH, SWORD, etc)
  - Frontend (https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular/) is the User Interface built on the REST API
  - Prior versions of DSpace (v6.x and below) used two different UIs (XMLUI and JSPUI). Those UIs are no longer supported in v7 (and above).
  - https://github.com/DSpace/RestContract
    - new DSpace REST API Contract beginning with version 7.0
    - At the ROOT of the API a HAL document lists all the primary endpoints allowing full discovery of the API.
    - all terms used are meant to reference RESTful terminology and/or terminology borrowed from Spring Data REST.

  - https://magda.io/
  - A federated, open-source data catalog for all your big data and small data
  - As an open data search engine
  - Powerful and scalable search based on ElasticSearch
  - Federated authentication via passport.js

- https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/lodex /js
  - Lodex is a tool to enable publishing a set of data csv, tsv, xml, json, ... in semantic web formats JSON-LD, N-Quads, ... and propose to manipulate them in a backoffice.
# data-ai
- https://github.com/Oxen-AI/oxen-release /apache2/202502/python/rust
  - https://oxen.ai/
  - fast data version control system for structured and unstructured machine learning datasets. 
  - We aim to make versioning datasets as easy as versioning code.
  - The interface mirrors git, but shines in many areas that git or git-lfs fall short. Oxen is built from the ground up for data, and is optimized to handle large datasets, and large files.
    - oxen clone https://hub.oxen.ai/ox/CatDogBBox
  - Oxen is comprised of a command line interface, as well as bindings for Rust 🦀, Python 🐍, and HTTP interfaces to make it easy to integrate into your workflow.
  - This repository contains the Python library that wraps the core Rust codebase. 
  - Oxen is designed to efficiently manage large datasets, including those with large individual files, for example CSV files with millions of rows. 
    - It also handles datasets comprising millions of individual files and directories such as the complete collection of ImageNet images.
  - Collaborate with your team (sync to an oxen-server)
  - Solutions like `git-lfs` are too slow when it comes to the scale of data we need for machine learning.
  - https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen /apache2/202503/rust
    - Oxen.ai's core rust library, server, and CLI
    - Oxen at it's core is a data version control library, written in Rust.
    - Oxen Server: Remote repositories have the same internal structure as local ones, with the caviate that all the data is in the .oxen dir and not duplicated into a "local workspace".
# metadata
- https://github.com/GuinsooLab/darkseal
  - A Single place to Discover, Collaborate, and Get your data right
  - Darkseal depends on following components to build a metadata platform:
    - JsonSchemas for defining Metadata Schemas
    - Dropwizard/Jetty for REST APIs
    - MySQL 8.x to store Metadata (Guinsoo is coming)
    - ElasticSearch/OpenElasticsearch 7.x to index Metadata and power

- https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode /GPL/202405/python/js
  - GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation, sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data.

- https://github.com/feup-infolab/dendro /202006/js/inactive
  - "Open-source Dropbox" with added description features. 
  - It is a data storage and description platform designed to help researchers and other users to describe their data files, built on Linked Open Data and ontologies. 
  - Users can use Dendro to publish data to CKAN, Zenodo, DSpace or EUDAT's B2Share and others.
