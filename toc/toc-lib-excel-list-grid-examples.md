    - While this project was originally intended for commercial release, I've decided it might be better off as an open source project
    - The reason for this is that during the initial development of the project I've discovered a number of projects that offer similar functionality to Grid studio.
    - First, there is an open source plug-in that integrates Python directly into Microsoft Excel called xlwings. 
    - Second, Python has evolved from IPython to Jupyter Notebooks to JupyterLab. 
    - Overall, projects like these meant that commercializing Grid studio would mean competing with these product substitutes that are frankly available for the incredibly low price of free.

# excel-engine
- https://github.com/NickStefan/rixif /201602/js
  - In early 2015, I had wanted to implement an entire excel experience in javascript.
  - With React, Immutable.js, and old school vanilla flux, I got pretty far
  - [How to implement a spreadsheet | Hacker News_201507](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9940126)
    - I implemented a spreadsheet in react, flux, immutable, and used a command pattern
    - I did not take the approach of cells actually observing each other. Instead I had a recursive function that worked from the entered cell 
    - The hardest part was updating the string representations of the formulas when you insert a new column or row, and then re-updating each cell's dependencies arrays.
    - One mistake I made was trying to implement the undo/redo to be totally reversable at every step. So every command stores the way to go both back and forward. In hindsight, I should have just stored forward commands and rebaked from the beginning when someone wanted to go back in time.
    - Handsontable.js. That library has some major design flaws. Handsontable only takes simple 'number' or 'string' value for each cell
