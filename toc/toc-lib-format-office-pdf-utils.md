  - VSCode extension for understanding and learning PDF syntax. 
  - This extension will NEVER render PDF pages or provide support like an interactive PDF viewer. There are other VSCode extensions and external applications which do this
  - Implementers with suitable PDF rendering and viewing technologies are encouraged to create their own VSCode extensions to render PDF pages to work along side this extension.
  - PDF COS syntax and content stream operator syntax highlighting
  - Technically all PDF files are binary files and should never be arbitrarily edited in, or saved from, text-based editors such as VSCode as this will break them
    - PDF files use precise byte offsets for locating objects and data, and can contain compressed or encrypted data. 
    - PDFs are NOT UTF-8
  - https://github.com/pdf-association/pdf-differences /apache2/202502
    - The PDF files in this repository are targeted test files highlighting specific issues seen across multiple widely-used implementations.

  - [BentoPDF is now open sourced : r/webdev _202510](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1o6lkwf/bentopdf_is_now_open_sourced/)
  - What does it do better / different compared to Stirling pdf?
    - Runs fully client side
    - You can merge pdf with ranges
    - You can crop each pdf page differently
    - You can fill and create form
  - i wonder if you can add "sign" feature using both imported signature or digital signature like in FoxitPDF. 
    - As a Linux user it's very difficult to find a decent application for digital signatures/certificates.
  - [BentoPDF is a self hostable PDF Toolkit : r/selfhosted _202510](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1o5borw/bentopdf_is_a_self_hostable_pdf_toolkit/)
    - Sterling is open core from version 1.0. So if this project adds team/user management and advanced authentication under the Apache 2.0 licence, there is a big advantage compared to Sterling PDF.

  - PDF editor in the browser – add text, checkboxes, pictures, signatures to PDF files. 
  - Merge, rotate PDF pages – iframe, script and React component
  - Client-based: the document and data filled in does not leave the browser
  - The library is a simple wrapper around an Iframe that loads SimplePDF on-demand (whenever the user clicks the wrapped link), as such the footprint for this "opening an Iframe" mechanism is very tiny
  - As for the editor itself, it's not open-source
    - The generation part is done using **PDF-lib** 
  - 🐛 SimplePDF Embed is a ~5KB wrapper that opens an iframe loading the proprietary SimplePDF editor hosted at https://{companyIdentifier}.simplepdf.com. The real editor code is closed-source and lives on their servers — this repo only contains the embed wrapper.

    - The PDF editor is completely free and does not require an account to be used.
    - I want to keep it for free for individuals, but there's a paid service for companies
    - I am resting on the shoulders of giants: I used every possible help (read open source work from others) and combined them into the result you're able to use. So I haven't luckily had to spend a lot of time dealing with the complexity of PDFs.

# parser-generator
- https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf /9.6kStar/BSD/202511/python
  - https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - A pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files
  - It can also add custom data, viewing options, and passwords to PDF files. 
  - pypdf can retrieve text and metadata from PDFs as well.
  - [How pypdf parses PDF files ](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/pypdf-parsing.html)
    - Finding and reading the cross-reference tables / trailer: The cross-reference table (xref table) is a table of byte offsets that indicate the locations of objects within the file
    - After locating the xref table and the trailer, pypdf proceeds to parse the objects in the PDF. 
    - Decoding content streams: The content of a PDF is typically stored in content streams, which are sequences of PDF operators and operands. 
  - [Reading the PDF metadata on large files _202507](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/discussions/3390)
    - Is there a way to get the PDF attributes like Creation Date without loading the whole file into memory? We have large multi-gigabyte files and are trying to process them on a fleet of smaller ECS instances. The streaming features of pypdf have been great, but would love to get the same metadata without loading the whole file into memory.
    - Have you tried to pass a buffered file stream as stream argument ?
  - [Implementation of get_contents ](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/discussions/3352)
    - `get_data()` is accessing the (decoded) byte data of the corresponding content stream, thus this only relevant when reading from the original PDF file.
    - skimming through the usages of self.pdf in ContentStream seems to indicate that this is used to avoid cloning if the content streams are both targeting the same PDF reference

- https://github.com/chromium/pdfium /apache2/202509/cpp/chromium
  - https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/
  - https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/+/HEAD/docs/getting-started.md
  - The PDF library used by the Chromium project
  - PDFium uses the same build tooling as Chromium. PDFium is located in` third_party/pdfium` in Chromium's source code.
  - PDFium uses GN to generate the build files and Ninja to execute the build files.
  - PDFium may be built either with or without JavaScript support, and with or without XFA forms support. Both of these features are enabled by default.
  - By default, the entire project builds with C++20.
  - https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries /MIT
    - Binary distribution of PDFium
  - https://github.com/embedpdf/embed-pdf-viewer /MIT/202511/ts
    - [PDF viewer using PDFium + WebAssembly — would love your input : r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1kydm90/pdf_viewer_using_pdfium_webassembly_would_love/)
    - open source PDF viewer called EmbedPDF, based on PDFium (the same rendering engine used in Chrome) compiled to WebAssembly.
    - It’s meant to be an alternative to PDF.js, with a focus on rendering accuracy and customizability. You can use it with a full UI out of the box, or headless for full control.
    - It’s MIT-licensed and framework-agnostic.
- https://github.com/pypdfium2-team/pypdfium2 /745Star/BSD/202603/python
  - https://pypdfium2.readthedocs.io/
  - an ABI-level Python 3 binding to PDFium, a powerful and liberal-licensed library for PDF rendering, inspection, manipulation and creation
  - It is built with ctypesgen and external PDFium binaries. The custom setup infrastructure provides a seamless packaging and installation process. A wide range of platforms is supported with pre-built packages.
  - pypdfium2 includes helpers to simplify common use cases, while the raw PDFium API (ctypes) remains accessible as well.
  - pypdfium2 and its ctypesgen fork are developed in sync, i.e. each pypdfium2 commit ought to be coupled with the then HEAD of pypdfium2-ctypesgen.
  - pypdfium2 itself is available by the terms and conditions of Apache-2.0 / BSD-3-Clause. Documentation and examples of pypdfium2 are licensed under CC-BY-4.0.
  - limitations
    - PDFium is inherently not thread-safe. 
    - PDFium's public interface does not provide access to the raw PDF data structure. It does not expose APIs to read/write PDF dictionaries, streams, name/number trees, etc. Instead, it merely offers a predefined set of abstracted functions. This considerably limits the library's potential, compared to other products such as `pikepdf`.
    - PDFium's non-public backend would provide extended capabilities, including raw access, but it is written in C++, which (unlike pure C) does not result in a stable ABI, so we cannot use it with ctypes. This means it's out of scope for this project.

    - Tesserocr is a Python/Pillow friendly library that uses libtesseract.
  - [Licensing _202002](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image/issues/124)
    - you're using MIT license while poppler is under GPL license. Could you please dispel my doubts?
      - Poppler is distributed under a copyleft license, namely GPL 2.0. If in your commercial application you modify Poppler and/or do static/dynamic linking on Poppler, you can be infringing(违反/侵犯) on their license by not releasing your source code.
      - That being said, it is by design that pdf2image does not in any way or form, link directly to poppler. All it does is call an already existing CLI utility that comes pre-installed on most Linux installation. As such, my code is distributed under MIT 
    - I'm reopening this since it's not clear to me if running pdf2image inside a docker container can still be considered as MIT compatible ?
      - TLDR: The container is not considered anything as it is not code, but GPL code can "live" with MIT code in a container without any issue.
