  - The modular and type-safe form library for any framework
  - Supported frameworks: React, Preact, Qwik, SolidJS, and Vue. Svelte will follow soon.
  - a schema-based, headless form library for JS frameworks. It manages form state and validation. 
  - its bundle size is small due to its modular design
  - Schema-based validation with Valibot
  - What makes Formisch unique is its framework-agnostic core, which is fully native to the framework you are using. It works by inserting framework-specific reactivity blocks when the core package is built

    - how is it different from Tanstack form
    - It’s much smaller (~2.5 kB vs. >10 kB), but it also has less functionality than TanStack Form in its current state. One of the biggest differences is our modular design. So only what you use ends up in your final bundle. When you choose Preact, Qwik, SolidJS, Svelte, or Vue as the framework, we use the native reactivity system (signals), which should result in better performance
  - 🐛 [Support other schema libraries through Standard Schema _202507](https://github.com/open-circle/formisch/issues/2)
    - Yes, I can replace the Valibot-specific code with the Standard Schema interface for v1. I am a Standard Schema co-creator by the way. However, I must point out that Formisch initializes the form store (each state of the form is a signal) based on the schema structure, but Standard Schema does not provide this information because each schema library is implemented differently. Supporting multiple schema libraries would therefore require us to use adapters for each one, which would decrease DX. 
    - Until the library is more popular it is probably not worth investing time into supporting Zod or other schema libraries as I should probably focus on providing docs and support for meta frameworks first.

    - What makes Formisch unique is its framework-agnostic core, It works by inserting framework-specific reactivity blocks when the core package is built. 
    - TanStack Form is implemented with a framework-agnostic core that has its own reactivity system. This system is then connected to the framework you are using via framework-specific adapters. This differs from how Formisch works under the hood.

  - https://formkit.com/
  - FormKit is a form-authoring framework ~~for Vue~~ 
  - supports its whole feature set for native HTML inputs (like select, checkbox, and textarea) 
  - https://x.com/jpschroeder/status/2039754919133974622 _202604
    - announcing FormKit for React.
    - We (the creators of FormKit) thought form libraries were no longer necessary, given the trajectory of coding agents. It turns out we were wrong, and we learned this the hard way. Need repeating conditional fields nested 3 layers deep inside a dynamic component, with accessibility, validation, internationalization, and backend error placement? Turns out coding agents aren’t great at that. It’s table stakes for FormKit.
    - ⚖️🐛 Schema. FormKit’s own inputs are not written using Vue or React — instead, FormKit has its own render schema — think of it like an AST for the DOM — and you can modify it on the fly. It’s not very human-friendly to write, but it turns out most models are already pretty well trained on FormKit’s schema.
    - Single component.  This was done to provide a better DX to human engineers.  It turns out this matters even more to coding agents than humans. No matter where your coding agent is, whenever it sees “FormKit” it immediately knows “oh, that’s part of the form’s data”.
    - No plumbing. FormKit doesn’t require any manual data collection, event listening, or state tracking. It does all this for you on a heavily tested, framework agnostic, self-assembling graph. 
    - FormKit, unlike most form frameworks in React, renders the actual DOM. 
    - Plugins. FormKit leans into the unstructured tree graph hard. The graph doesn’t just collect data, it also passes down configuration and plugins. 
  - do you support  standard-schema, it seems popular and futuristic
    - No, we have our own well established one at this point: [FormKit Schema ](https://formkit.com/essentials/schema)

    - Grist has the ability to create forms that are automatically connected to their spreadsheets. Though it doesn't seem like you can create sophisticated forms (with some logic in them for example) just yet.
    - As someone that built a 20m ARR survey product... The only difference between this and something making millions is a sales team.
    - I really like that you are using nestjs, idk why some devs hate it
    - Best makes JavaScript look like Java, it’s needlessly complex and just encourages vast amounts of boilerplate. Awful stuff.
