# office-diff
- https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/modern-office-git-diff /MIT/202204/js/inactive
  - An experiment in tracking and diffing versions of modern Microsoft Office files in Git.
  - Modern Office file formats are ZIP archives with XML files in them.
  - This is achieved using a PowerShell script which unpacks the ZIP file to a tracked directory, formats the XML files for nice diff and tracks the formatted files as well.
# libreoffice
- https://github.com/unoconv/unoserver /875Star/MIT/202511/python
  - Using LibreOffice as a server for converting documents.
  - LibreOffice has a listener mode, where it can listen for commands via a port, and load and convert documents without exiting and reloading the software. This lowers the CPU load when converting many documents with somewhere between 50% and 75%, meaning you can convert somewhere between two and four times as many documents in the same time using a listener.
