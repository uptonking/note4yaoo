  - A Rosetta stone for typesetting engines.
  - This project's goal is to provide a chrestomathy for typesetting similar to what Rosetta Code does for programming languages. 
  - 🆚️ SILE, Typst, LaTeX, paged.js, WeasyPrint, Speedata, groff, Patoline, SATySFi
  - The samples here are designed to compare and/or contrast the approaches taken to various typesetting situations by different typesetting engines.
  - The emphasis is less on document markup languages, programming languages, or actual content and more on the way layout and orthographic features are achieved.

  - This repository contains the Typst compiler and its CLI, which is everything you need to compile Typst documents locally.
