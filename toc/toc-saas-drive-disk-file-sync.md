- 需要同步的场景
  - app设置项，如vscode设置，pwa列表
  - app内容，如笔记内容
  - 浏览器标签页部分设置和布局，或扩展列表
  - 同步方式，对大数据或小数据都可以放在云盘，需要自己读取解析

- tips
  - 网盘实现: file-manager + storage-provider
  - 开源cms的files/media通常包含网盘的常用功能
  - 若强调文件预览，则更推荐专门的软件
  - 对于视频类的预览，推荐plex

- https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud /2.1kStar/apache2/202509/go
  - https://opencloud.eu/
  - This the main repository of the OpenCloud server. It contains the golang codebase for the backend services.
  - 🛢️ The OpenCloud backend does not use a database. It stores all data in the filesystem. By default, the root directory of the backend is `$HOME/.opencloud/`.
  - Architecture: Built with a microservices approach
  - The OpenCloud backend authenticates users via OpenID Connect using either an external IdP like Keycloak or the embedded LibreGraph Connect identity provider.
  - 📱 支持 web/win/mac/linux/android/ios
  - 📡 尝试自定义客户端

  - [Support any S3 provider instead of just Minio _202507](https://github.com/orgs/opencloud-eu/discussions/1149)
    - This is a misunderstanding. Every S3 compatible Storage should work.
  - [[Feature] External S3 storage additionally mounting and encryption _202505](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/opencloud/issues/875)
    - Is it currently possible to mount an additional s3 bucket (to the existing primary) for data storage into opencloud? 
    - OpenCloud can be set up with the so called DecomposedS3 storage driver, which uses S3 as storage for the binary blobs, in addition to a little bit of Posix storage for the metadata storage, that references to the S3.
    - I think it should be possible to also encrypt the S3 buckets, independently from OpenCloud, as a feature of the storage
    - OpenCloud however does not yet support client side S3 encryption.

  - https://doc.owncloud.com/ocis/next/
  - ownCloud Infinite Scale (oCIS) is the new file sync & share platform that will be the foundation of your data management platform.
  - [Provide login option for Basic Auth and SSO at the same time _202508](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/11601)
    - this will be hard to implement as requested. When having an external IDP configured, oCIS uses that as source of truth for the authentication. That means that ocis itself does not store any password information internally, hence it can't authenticate basic auth requests. I do not think it is a good idea to duplicate this password information. 
    - A better solution to this problem is in my opinion to allow multiple IDPs. This would give the user the opportunity to choose its identity provider on login. These IDPs would be independent from each other, means each one will have their own password.
  - [OIDC can't be set up for the hardcoded clients · Issue · owncloud/ocis](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/9389)
    - The OIDC implementation that ownCloud uses is fundamentally broken: the clients are not authenticating in a way that anyone considers rational, and which is incompatible with many identity providers. ownCloud's response here is nothing short of absolutely wild, from suggesting small home users pay an enterprise subscription to rationalizing the why it's not broken "because of the history".

    - 👷202010: cloud storage support is out of the scope of this project. As @fdefilippo mentioned you can mound your s3 bucket using fuse.
    - A work-around I've found when trying to get S3 to act as the storage back-end for Filebrowser, at least when deploying Filebrowser as a container, is to mount the Filebrowser storage folder to an NFS share interface tying back to S3.
  - [add minio as file storage  _202202](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/issues/1809)

    - Implement downloading an entire folder (.zip) along with its child files and folders.
    - I can't think of a way where this can be done without a server. So this will probably break our policy of "your files stay with you and we don't access it".
    - Will need to research a bit on this about how this can be done without needing to have a server.

    - CRDT semantics by default keep all tombstones, because they are necessary for reconciliation
    - Garage makes use of Sled's atomic operations (such as compare-and-swap and transactions) to ensure that only tombstones that have been correctly propagated to other nodes are ever deleted from the local entry tree.

  - WebDAV/gRPC/HTTP high performance server to link high level clients to storage backends
  - Reva is an interoperability platform consisting of several daemons written in Go. 
  - It acts as bridge between high-level clients (mobile, web, desktop) and the underlying storage (CephFS, EOS, local filesytems). 
  - It also exports a high-performance gRPC API, codenamed CS3 APIs, to easily integrate with other systems. 
  - Reva is meant to be a high performant and customizable HTTP and gRPC server.
  - [Decide on HTTP chunked-data transfer protocol _201910](https://github.com/cs3org/reva/issues/290)
    - Compare different chunking data transfer protocols and chose the one that everyone should implement.
    - The protocol needs to allow to upload by chunks of data (files are split into small chunks) and resumable, if the transfer is cut, the client should be able to discover what are the missing chunks to be uploaded.
    - tus.io and ownCloud rely solely on HTTP headers while the rest rely on some encoded payload.
    - @butonic prefers relying only on headers and I also share the same opinion.
    - I think `tus` is a great approach. IMHO tus and ownCloud Chunking NG share the same basic ideas, which is cool, but tus is way further on the way to become a real standard: It has many supporters, people who verified it's concepts and wrote code and put it in production. That alone makes it the top candidate
    - the decision is that we use tus.

  - https://giftless.datopian.com/
  - Giftless is a Python implementation of a Git LFS Server. 
  - It is designed with flexibility in mind, to allow pluggable storage backends, transfer methods and authentication methods.
  - Giftless supports the basic Git LFS transfer mode with the following storage backends:
    - Local storage
    - Amazon S3 Storage
    - Google Cloud Storage
    - Azure Blob Storage with direct-to-cloud or streamed transfers
  - In addition, Giftless implements a custom transfer mode called multipart-basic, which is designed to take advantage of many vendors' multipart upload capabilities. It requires a specialized Git LFS client to use, and is currently not supported by standard Git LFS.

  - Peer-to-peer file transfers in your browser
  - Works on most mobile browsers, including Mobile Safari.
  - 依赖nextjs、PeerJS for WebRTC、Redis(optional)
  - Using WebRTC, FilePizza eliminates the initial upload step required by other web-based file sharing services. 
    - files are sent directly from your browser to the downloader's browser. They never pass through our servers. 
    - Transfers are now directly from the uploader to the downloader's browser (WebRTC without WebTorrent) with faster handshakes.
    - Uploaders can monitor the progress of the transfer and stop it if they want.
  - Support for uploading multiple files at once, which downloaders receive as a zip file.
  - Streaming downloads with a Service Worker.
  - Out-of-process storage of server state using Redis.

  - https://github.com/mifi/ezshare
  - A simple file server that lets you easily share many big files like photos and videos with friends (or between your devices) over a local network without requiring an internet connection.
  - If you don't want to install Node.js, you can download a zipped executable of ezshare
  - It starts an HTTP server that lists all files and directories in the directory
  - Then anyone can then connect to the server and download files or automatically generated ZIP of whole directories (kind of like Google Drive.) 
  - The client can also upload files to the server via their browser, and clipboard card be shared both ways. A QR code is generated for convenience.
