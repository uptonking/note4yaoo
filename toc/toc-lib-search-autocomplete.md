  - https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch
  - OpenSearch is a collection of simple formats for the sharing of search results.
  - launched in 2005 by A9.com, an Amazon subsidiary, as a means for sharing search queries and search results in a standardized format.
  - The specification has been unchanged and stable for over a decade
  - The OpenSearch protocol lets you describe a search engine for your website, so that browsers or other search clients can use that search engine.

  - It saves adding extra, compacted services on the server. 
  - A local search index will be quicker, there is no network overhead, and will remain available and usable even without a network connection.
  - [Still maintained?](https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/issues/504)
