- pouchdb /15.4kStar/apache2/202211/js
  - https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb
  - https://pouchdb.com/
  - PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.
  - It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online
  - PouchDB is not a self-contained database; 
    - it is a CouchDB-style abstraction layer over other databases. By default, 
    - PouchDB ships with the IndexedDB adapter for the browser, and a LevelDB adapter in Node.js.

- acebase /279Star/MIT/202212/ts
  - https://github.com/appy-one/acebase
  - A fast, low memory, transactional, index & query enabled NoSQL database engine and server for node.js and browser with realtime data change notifications.
  - üëâüèª Inspired by (and largely compatible with) the Firebase realtime database, with additional functionality and less data sharding/duplication.
  - By default, AceBase uses its own binary database format in Node.js environments, and IndexedDB (or LocalStorage) in the browser to store its data. 
    - However, it is also possible to use AceBase's realtime capabilities, and have the actual data stored in other databases. 
    - Currently, AceBase has built-in adapters for MSSQL, SQLite in Node.js environments; and IndexedDB, LocalStorage, SessionStorage for the browser. 
    - It also possible to create your own custom storage adapters, so wherever you'd want to store your data
  - When you're using AceBase with an IndexedDB or LocalStorage backend, you might notice that if you change data in one open tab, those changes do not raise change events in other open tabs monitoring that same data.
  - AceBase is designed to run in a Node.js environment, as it (by default) requires the `fs` filesystem to store its data and indexes. 
    - However, since v0.9.0 it is now also possible to use AceBase databases in the browser! 
  - When you're using AceBase with an IndexedDB or LocalStorage backend, you might notice that if you change data in one open tab, those changes do not raise change events in other open tabs
    - This is because IndexedDB or LocalStorage databases do not raise change events themselves
    - AceBase is now able to communicate with other tabs using the `BroadcastChannel` ,but disabled by default

  - üëâüèª RxDB is not a self contained database. 
    - It is a wrapper around another database that implements the `RxStorage` interface. 
    - At the moment you can either use `PouchDB` or `Dexie.js` or `LokiJS` as underlaying storage. 
    - Each of them respectively has it's own adapters that can be swapped out, depending on your needs. 
    - For example you can use and IndexedDB based storage in the browser, and an SQLite storage in your hybrid app

    - Fast in-memory SQL data processing for BI and ERP applications on fat clients
    - Easy ETL and options for persistence by data import / manipulation / export of several formats
    - All major browsers, Node.js, and mobile applications

- WatermelonDB /8.7kStar/MIT/202211/js
  - https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB
  - https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/
  - Reactive & asynchronous database for powerful React and React Native apps
  - Relational. Built on rock-solid SQLite foundation
  - Framework-agnostic. Use JS API to plug into other UI frameworks
  - Reactive. (Optional) RxJS API
  - Lazy: Nothing is loaded until it's requested. 
    - And since all querying is performed directly on the rock-solid SQLite database on a separate native thread, most queries resolve in an instant.
    - But unlike using SQLite directly, Watermelon is fully observable.
  - [Adapters - WatermelonDB documentation](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/Implementation/Adapters.html)
    - The idea for the Watermelon architecture is to be database-agnostic.
    - Collection/Model/Query is the reactive layer
    - DatabaseAdapter is the imperative layer
    - SQLiteAdapter is an adapter for React Native, based on SQLite
    - LokiJSAdapter is an adapter for the web, based around LokiJS
  - [Sync - WatermelonDB documentation](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/Advanced/Sync.html)
    - Note that Watermelon is only a local database ‚Äî you need to bring your own backend.
    - You can build your own custom sync engine using synchronization primitives
    - You can use the sync engine(built-in sync adapter) Watermelon provides out of the box, and you only need to provide two API endpoints on your backend that conform to Watermelon sync protocol
    - `synchronize(dbName, pullChanges, pushChanges)` Âú®ÂÆ¢Êà∑Á´ØË∞ÉÁî®
    - "Turbo Login" syncing can only be used for the initial (login) sync, not for incremental syncs.
    - WatermelonDB has been designed with the assumption that there is no difference between Local IDs (IDs of records and their relations in a WatermelonDB database) and Remote IDs (IDs on the backend server). 
    - So a local app can create new records, generating their IDs, and the backend server will use this ID as the true ID.
    - sync could only send changed fields and server could automatically always just apply those changed fields to the server version (since that's what per-column client-wins resolver will do anyway)
  - [Sync implementation - WatermelonDB documentation](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/Implementation/SyncImpl.html)
    - master/replica - server is the source of truth, client has a full copy and syncs back to server (no peer-to-peer syncs)
    - two phase sync: first pull remote changes to local app, then push local changes to server
    - client resolves conflicts
    - content-based, not time-based conflict resolution
    - eventual consistency (client and server are consistent at the moment of successful pull if no local changes need to be pushed)
    - conflicts are resolved using per-column client-wins strategy: in conflict, server version is taken except for any column that was changed locally since last sync.
    - sync is performed for the entire database at once, not per-collection
    - non-blocking: local database writes (but not reads) are only momentarily locked when writing data but user can safely make new changes throughout the process

  - https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS

- https://github.com/typicaljoe/taffydb /201509/js/ÂçïÊñá‰ª∂
  - TaffyDB is an open source JavaScript library that provides powerful in-memory database capabilities to both browser and server applications.
  - We created TaffyDB easily and efficiently manipulate these 'tables' with a uniform and familiar SQL-like interface.
  - SQL inspired features such as insert, update, unique, count, and more
- https://github.com/chjj/tiny /201406/js/ÂçïÊñá‰ª∂
  - tiny is an in-process document/object store for node.js.
  - inspired by nStore, however, its goal was to implement real querying which goes easy on the memory.
  - It supports mongo-style querying, or alternatively a "mapreduce-like" interface similar to CouchDB's views.

- https://github.com/knadh/localStorageDB /202011/js
  - a simple layer over localStorage (and sessionStorage) that provides a set of functions to store structured data like databases and tables. 
  - It provides basic insert/update/delete/query capabilities. 
  - localStorageDB has no dependencies, and is not based on WebSQL. 
  - Underneath it all, the structured data is stored as serialized JSON in localStorage or sessionStorage.
# db-json
- lowdb /18.7Star/MIT/202211/ts
  - https://github.com/typicode/lowdb
  - Simple to use local JSON database.
  - supports Node, Electron and the browser
  - adapters: JSONFile/Memory/LocalStorage/TextFile
    - Change storage, file format (JSON, YAML,XML,remote-storage ...) or add encryption via adapters
    - An adapter is a simple class that just needs to expose two methods: read/write
  - Lowdb doesn't support Node's cluster module.
  - If you have large JavaScript objects (~10-100MB) you may hit some performance issues. 
    - This is because whenever you call `db.write`, the whole `db.data` is serialized using `JSON.stringify` and written to storage.
    - If you plan to scale, it's highly recommended to use databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB instead.
