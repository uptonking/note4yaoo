  - The sql syntax parser is home-made. Which means that some features are not implemented, and will be considered as invalid syntaxes.
  - limitations
    - Materialized views are implemented as views (meaning that they are always up-to-date, without needing them to refresh)
    - Indices implementations are basic
    - All number-like types are all handled as javascript numbers, meaning that types like `numeric(x,y)` could not behave as expected.
    - No support for timezones

- pouchdb /15.4kStar/apache2/202211/js
  - https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb
  - https://pouchdb.com/
  - PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.
  - It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online
  - PouchDB is not a self-contained database; 
    - it is a CouchDB-style abstraction layer over other databases. By default, 
    - PouchDB ships with the IndexedDB adapter for the browser, and a LevelDB adapter in Node.js.

- rxdb /17.6kStar/Apache2/202206/ts
  - https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb
  - https://rxdb.info/
  - ‰æùËµñrxjs7
  - A fast, offline-first, reactive database for JavaScript Applications
  - Êú™ÂÆûÁé∞Full Text SearchÔºå‰ΩÜÁ¨¨‰∏âÊñπÊîØÊåÅ
  - a NoSQL-database for JavaScript Applications like Websites, hybrid Apps, Electron-Apps and NodeJs. 
  - üëâüèª RxDB is not a self contained database. 
    - It is a wrapper around another database that implements the `RxStorage` interface. 
    - At the moment you can either use `PouchDB` or `Dexie.js` or `LokiJS` as underlaying storage. 
    - Each of them respectively has it's own adapters that can be swapped out, depending on your needs. 
    - For example you can use and IndexedDB based storage in the browser, and an SQLite storage in your hybrid app
  - [Add RxDB CRDT Plugin_202210](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/4087)
  - [crdt plugin](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/docs-src/crdt.md)
    - with crdt, all document writes are represented as CRDT operations in plain JSON. 
    - The CRDT **operations are stored together with the document** and each time a conflict arises, the CRDT conflict handler will automatically merge the operations in a deterministic way.
  - [backlog should be implemented in the future](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/orga/BACKLOG.md)

- nedb /13.1kStar/MIT/201602/js
  - https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb
  - Embedded persistent or in memory database for Node.js, nw.js, Electron and browsers, 100% JavaScript, no binary dependency. 
  - API is a subset of MongoDB's and it's plenty fast.
    - One datastore is the equivalent of a MongoDB collection
  - A copy of the whole database is kept in memory. This is not much on the expected kind of datasets (20MB for 10, 000 2KB documents).
  - You can use NeDB as an in-memory only datastore or as a persistent datastore. 

- WatermelonDB /9.6kStar/MIT/202310/js+flow
  - https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB
  - https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/
  - Reactive & asynchronous database for powerful React and React Native apps
  - ‰æùËµñsqlite„ÄÅsimdjson„ÄÅlokijs„ÄÅrxjs7
  - Relational. Built on rock-solid SQLite foundation
  - Framework-agnostic. Use JS API to plug into other UI frameworks
  - Reactive. (Optional) RxJS API
  - Lazy: Nothing is loaded until it's requested. 
    - And since all querying is performed directly on the rock-solid SQLite database on a separate native thread, most queries resolve in an instant.
    - But unlike using SQLite directly, Watermelon is fully observable.
  - [Disable 'rxjs' dependency_202204](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/1301)
    - rxjs is used by WatermelonDB internals in some places, hence this is not possible to remove it
  - [[Question] More details on offline first?_202207](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/1351)
  - [WatermelonDB, a database for React and React Native apps | Hacker News_201809](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17950992)
  - [Adapters - WatermelonDB documentation](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/Implementation/Adapters.html)
    - The idea for the Watermelon architecture is to be database-agnostic.
    - Collection/Model/Query is the reactive layer
    - DatabaseAdapter is the imperative layer
    - SQLiteAdapter is an adapter for React Native, based on SQLite
    - LokiJSAdapter is an adapter for the web, based around LokiJS
  - [Sync - WatermelonDB documentation](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/Advanced/Sync.html)
    - Note that Watermelon is only a local database ‚Äî you need to bring your own backend.
    - You can build your own custom sync engine using synchronization primitives
    - You can use the sync engine(built-in sync adapter) Watermelon provides out of the box, and you only need to provide two API endpoints on your backend that conform to Watermelon sync protocol
    - `synchronize(dbName, pullChanges, pushChanges)` Âú®ÂÆ¢Êà∑Á´ØË∞ÉÁî®
    - "Turbo Login" syncing can only be used for the initial (login) sync, not for incremental syncs.
    - WatermelonDB has been designed with the assumption that there is no difference between Local IDs (IDs of records and their relations in a WatermelonDB database) and Remote IDs (IDs on the backend server). 
    - So a local app can create new records, generating their IDs, and the backend server will use this ID as the true ID.
    - sync could only send changed fields and server could automatically always just apply those changed fields to the server version (since that's what per-column client-wins resolver will do anyway)
  - [Sync implementation - WatermelonDB documentation](https://nozbe.github.io/WatermelonDB/Implementation/SyncImpl.html)
    - master/replica - server is the source of truth, client has a full copy and syncs back to server (no peer-to-peer syncs)
    - üëâüèª two phase sync: first pull remote changes to local app, then push local changes to server
    - client resolves conflicts
    - content-based, not time-based conflict resolution
    - eventual consistency (client and server are consistent at the moment of successful pull if no local changes need to be pushed)
    - conflicts are resolved using per-column client-wins strategy: in conflict, server version is taken except for any column that was changed locally since last sync.
    - sync is performed for the entire database at once, not per-collection
    - non-blocking: local database writes (but not reads) are only momentarily locked when writing data but user can safely make new changes throughout the process

- warehouse /188Star/MIT/202309/ts/hexo
  - https://github.com/hexojs/warehouse
  - https://hexojs.github.io/warehouse/
  - A JSON database with Models, Schemas, and a flexible querying interface.
  - It powers the wildly successful static site generator Hexo.
  - ‰æùËµñjsonparse„ÄÅbluebird„ÄÅgraceful-fs
  - the major performance overhead of Hexo is not reading or writing db.json, but processing the cross-refs, e.g. finding posts with a tag or tags of a post.
  - [Why does hexo use this database implementation?](https://github.com/hexojs/warehouse/issues/13)
    - One idea I can think of is that you can index all the assets and get access to it for use synchronously
    - nedb doesn't have schemas

- acebase /279Star/MIT/202310/ts
  - https://github.com/appy-one/acebase
  - A fast, low memory, transactional, index & query enabled NoSQL database engine and server for node.js and browser with realtime data change notifications.
  - üëâüèª Inspired by (and largely compatible with) the Firebase realtime database, with additional functionality and less data sharding/duplication.
  - By default, AceBase uses its own binary database format in Node.js environments, and IndexedDB (or LocalStorage) in the browser to store its data. 
    - However, it is also possible to use AceBase's realtime capabilities, and have the actual data stored in other databases. 
    - Currently, AceBase has built-in adapters for MSSQL, SQLite in Node.js environments; and IndexedDB, LocalStorage, SessionStorage for the browser. 
    - It also possible to create your own custom storage adapters, so wherever you'd want to store your data
  - When you're using AceBase with an IndexedDB or LocalStorage backend, you might notice that if you change data in one open tab, those changes do not raise change events in other open tabs monitoring that same data.
  - AceBase is designed to run in a Node.js environment, as it (by default) requires the `fs` filesystem to store its data and indexes. 
    - However, since v0.9.0 it is now also possible to use AceBase databases in the browser
  - When you're using AceBase with an IndexedDB or LocalStorage backend, you might notice that if you change data in one open tab, those changes do not raise change events in other open tabs
    - This is because IndexedDB or LocalStorage databases do not raise change events themselves
    - AceBase is now able to communicate with other tabs using the `BroadcastChannel` ,but disabled by default
  - [Protocol for other languages ¬∑ appy-one/acebase](https://github.com/appy-one/acebase/discussions/79)
  - https://github.com/appy-one/acebase-core
    - Core functionality for AceBase, no need to install manually. See acebase-client and acebase-server
    - some source files have a browser-specific counterpart
    - rxjs is an optional dependency that only needs installing when any of AceBase's observe methods are used.
    -  If for some reason rxjs is not available (eg in test suite), we can provide a shim.

- lovefield /6.8kStar/Apache2/202005/js/inactive
  - https://github.com/google/lovefield
  - Lovefield is a relational database for web apps.
  - Written in JavaScript, works cross-browser. 
  - üëâüèª Provides SQL-like APIs that are fast, safe, and easy to use.

  - Lovefield uses a plug-in architecture for data stores. All data stores implement `lf.BackStore` interface so that query engine can be decoupled from actual storage technology.
  - [Lovefield wraps IndexedDB objects in different classes](https://github.com/google/lovefield/blob/master/docs/dd/02_data_store.md)
  - [Is lovefield good for big data storage of 3GB or so?_201611](https://groups.google.com/g/lovefield-users/c/ky60q5DCrs4)
    - Unfortunately no. Lovefield currently has a (significant) limitation that all data is kept in an in-memory cache. 
    - You could instead only store metadata about your blobs/arraybuffers in Lovefield, and place the actual files in some other persistent storage. This approach has already been used by some Lovefield clients

  - an embedded SQL database that stays in sync.
  - Built from the ground up and open source, it runs in the browser or the backend.
  - SKDB is a general-purpose SQL database that lets you subscribe to changes to your queries. 
  - Through a new construction called "virtual views", you can ask the database to keep a particular view up-to-date at all times
  - SKDB can also process ephemeral streams of data which can be used to receive alerts or to compute real-time analytics.
  - SKDB is inspired by SQLite and supports the same subset of SQL (including transactions).

- https://github.com/kappa-db/kappa-core /ISC/202011/js/inactive
  - Minimal peer-to-peer database, based on kappa architecture.
  - kappa-core is built on an abstraction called a kappa architecture, or "event sourcing". 
    - This differs from the traditional approach to databases, which is centered on storing the latest value for each key in the database.
    - In contrast, **kappa architecture centers on a primitive called the "append-only log"** as its single source of truth.
    - Each entry in a log is addressable by its "sequence number" (starting at 0, then 1, 2, 3, ...). In the case of kappa-core, which uses hypercore underneath
  - kappa-core still uses tables like the above, though. 
    - However, instead of being the source of truth, these **tables are generated (or materialized) from the log data**, providing a view of the log data in a new or optimized context. 
    - These are called materialized views.

- https://github.com/mikeal/CADB /202011/js/inactive
  - Experimental single file content addressed database.
  - "Content address" means that data is keyed by a hash digest.
  - CADB is a single file database for storing content addressed block data. 
  - You can think of it like a key/value store where the keys MUST be hash digests, of a sufficient length and security, and the value is arbitrary binary data.
  - CADB is a special B+ tree which is both sorted and balanced using hash digests. 
    - The keys (digests) are sorted by binary comparison 
    - and the tree's structure is chunked using randomness derived from the tail of each hash. 
    - This produces a self-balancing and well sorted structure on-disc.

- https://codeberg.org/small-tech/jsdb /202311/js/NoDeps

  - A small and simple data layer for basic persistence and querying.
  - For Node.js: will not work in the browser
  - all data is kept in memory and, without tweaks, cannot exceed 1.4GB in size(nodejs limit)
  - Streaming writes on update: writes are streamed to disk to an append-only transaction log as JavaScript statements and are both quick (in the single-digit milliseconds region on a development laptop with an SSD drive) and as safe as we can make them (synchronous at the kernel level).
  - No schema, no migrations: again, this is meant to be a very simple persistence, query, and observation layer for local server-side data
  - JSDB tables are written into JavaScript Data Format (JSDF) files. 
    - A JSDF file is just es6 module 
    - When you load in a JSDB table, JSDB will, by default, compact the JSDF file.

  - https://twitter.com/tomlarkworthy/status/1688132733246033920
    - I've been noodling with the concept of a vendorless BaaS by using an s3-compatible API as the backend. 
    - By hacking object versioning you get serialisability and atomic bulk updates. 
    - Its a real DB! Here it's using a local minio instance. Might try backblaze next.
    - Oh I have to expose the ETag header in the CORS config thats improved things to 400ms sometimes but I still have too many preflight requests
    - The sync protocol was designed using object versioning so that the logical names intuitively map to storage names, but then I realised R2, my favourite s3-like doesn't do versions. So now I had to redo it with timestamped suffixes. Total redesign with tricky clock skew defenses

    - Bind does something like this (but not with JSON).
    - You have to run a ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù command before editing the database directly (so it can flush the current version of the database, and redirect writes to memory + log), and then ‚Äúthaw‚Äù so it can read your changes and apply the log of updates to it.
# db-distributed
- orbit-db /7.4kStar/MIT/202301/js
  - https://github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb
  - OrbitDB is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. 
  - OrbitDB **uses IPFS as its data storage** and Libp2p Pubsub to automatically sync databases with peers.
  - It's an eventually consistent database that uses Merkle-CRDTs for conflict-free database writes and merges
  - OrbitDB provides various types of databases for different data models and use cases
  - All databases are implemented on top of `ipfs-log`, an immutable, cryptographically verifiable, operation-based CRDT
  - https://github.com/berty/go-orbit-db
    - Go version of P2P Database on IPFS
    - The majority of this code was vastly derived from the JavaScript's orbit-db project.
  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22918714
    - OrbitDB's core is an append-only, immutable log CRDT.The log in OrbitDB is a Merkle-DAG, so, a graph.
    - Key-Value databases, feeds, and other data model types that OrbitDB supports by default, are all built on that log. You can also create your custom database types, ie. custom data models.

  - Orbit is a composable data framework for managing the complex needs of today's web applications.
  - Although Orbit is **primarily used as a flexible client-side ORM**, it can also be used server-side in Node.js.
  - Interact with data from a variety of sources: a REST server, a WebSocket stream, an IndexedDB backup, an in-memory store, etc.
  - Work offline, work online, and seamlessly transition between both modes.
  - Support undo„ÄÅredo

- https://github.com/genderev/assassin /202009/js/inactive
  - Assassin is a decentralized database that uses background threads to kill slow JavaScript.
  - I ended up creating this database partly because IndexedDB is disabled in private browsing, which means none of these databases work for me.
  - Assassin is a key/value store that supports mapping a key to its corresponding value.
  - System Architecture: The DAT protocol distributes and hosts data between many computers, so there is no one location where data is stored. Assassin relies on the the DAT protocol for data persistence. The metadata of the key-value pairs are stored in a distributed `trie` structure.
  - Storage Model: Assassin sends data to the server, which then stores the metadata in the distributed file system Hyperdrive, which is built on the DAT protocol
