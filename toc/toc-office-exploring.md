  - Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper.
  - Paperless-ngx is compatible with many different scanners and scanning tools.
  - Once you've got Paperless setup, you need to start feeding documents into it
    - OCR the Document
    - create an archivable PDF/A document from your document. 
    - performs automatic matching of tags, correspondents and types on the document before storing it in the database.
    - The primary method of getting documents into your database is by putting them in the consumption directory. 
  - Paperless-ngx is the official successor to the original Paperless & Paperless-ng projects 
  - Utilizes the open-source `Tesseract` engine to recognize more than 100 languages.
  - Documents are saved as PDF/A format which is designed for long term storage, alongside the unaltered originals.
  - Paperless stores your documents plain on disk. Filenames and folders are managed by paperless and their format can be configured freely
