    - v1: React, Snowpack, Material UI; 146kb
    - v2: snowpack to vite, jss to styled-components; 120kb
    - v3: react to preact; 110kb
    - v4: styled-components to css modules; 85kb
    - v5: code splitting with lazy(); 62kb
    - v6: preact to svelte in 2 days; 28.5kb
    - The process: Literally, just copy-pasted everything 😂️
    - Jotai as global state library is very close to Svelte stores, so it was effortless.
    - Moving styles was literally just copy-pasting, *without any changes*
    - Svelte Code is much simpler. Everything about it was simpler and shorter than JSX code before.
    - Svelte Motion is a superb, superb thing!!!
