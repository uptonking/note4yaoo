- ## 仅供参考; 很多人问要投资什么编程栈。我觉得目前主流的就俩，①Java，有饭吃；②前端，有饭吃但容易触及天花板，后期容易为了突破老搞些风骚走位公众号啥的。

  - 算法不行了，毕竟用户量不增长后，算法不太需要突破了，搞好 CRUD 就行；移动端也就这样了；嗯，还有嵌入式吧，好像还不错。总之，CRUD 才是保命狗头。
- 什么算法不需要突破？

- ## [创业公司被大公司收购是一种什么体验？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/21355098)
- 以上就是我前后三次被收购的经历。我一直认为，公司被收购，也许不能算做世俗意义上的成功，但如果做一个公司，目标就是上市的话，我觉得恐怕更不切实际。
  - 那些所谓小而美、能自己养活自己的公司当然存在，但似乎又不能满足很多人的创业欲望，更何况所谓小而美的背后，更大可能是你并没有的资源。
- 资本驱动之下，创业公司被并购一定会变成一个最常见的退出方式，机会、平台、价钱合适，就卖吧。毕竟如果你是一个创业爱好者的话，时间成本才是最贵的，所以记得锁定期也不要签太久哦。

- 对于很多实力相对较弱的小型创业公司来说，被大公司收购，是他们最好的结局，否则等待他们的恐怕也只是关门解散。

- 我司马上被并购了，蛋疼中.... 创始员工，并没有股份，准备找下家了

- [公司被收购后的经历 - 知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/580436114)
- 从开发主力到小角色
  - 新环境，你以前做什么是不重要的，一切需要听从安排。
- 工作流程和组织架构很重要
  - 收购后的前期，开发组长级别的员工去别的项目当普通的开发。
  - 让我惊讶的是，他们去了那些组以后就只发挥一个开发组员的能量。
  - 以前那些“攻击性”的做事风格已经荡然无存。只考虑自己的开发进度的事项。
- 代码写的好或技术能力强未必会重用
  - 评价你的人，或是决定你命运的人往往不是看你代码的人。
  - 对开发的评价不是已代码为基础，是这个人能不能满足上司的需求。而你的上司未必是写代码的人。
- 有不按照套路出牌的组员，损失的是优秀的组员
  - 觉得受到不公平的待遇，会悄悄的
- 最有效的学习方式就是实战
  - 结果忙碌了1年的项目后，发现自己全忘了
  - 等你真正去使用具体的技术的时候集中精力去研究语法和使用方法。

- 我最近比较喜欢看动物世界(虽看着很残忍，但是很现实)。
  - 弱肉强食，适者生存。

- ## 为什么很多人的创业目标是被大资本收购？
- https://www.zhihu.com/question/564979019/answers/updated
- 不见得都是资本收购，很多被同行、竞争对手收购。
  - 创业真不是那么简单的，特别是互联网、科技行业，红利时期已经过了，格局基本已定。

- 如果被大资本看上了，表示大资本要进场了。
  - 这时候，你要掂量一下了，自己应该是没有实力硬刚大资本的。你拒绝了大资本，大资本要么收购你的竞争对手要么找人组团队下场。自己公司的业务可以想象会受到多大影响。
  - 与其这样，不如谈个对自己/公司有利的条件，开始下一次创业/退休吧。

- 因为当今不是乱世了，各行各业都有，老大，老二，老三。想靠自己杀出一条血路干掉老大老二老三基本不太可能，打不过就加入是一个比较好的选择。

- ## 我看别人的产品增长曲线那是真曲线，我的只能叫增长直线，斜率几乎都没有

- 随着技术长期没有创新，最后会不会落入到这样一种场景，只有大厂无法控制成本的中小项目，才适合独立开发者来做。类似赚的辛苦钱。当然有排他性技术或者创新能力的独立开发者不受任何限制，那就是讨论的个人如何积累创新的问题了。
  - 所有选择好赛道很重要，要不都是感动自己

- ## 今天和一个做内容营销的聊天。才发现 worse is better 竟快成内容营销的第一性原理了。
- https://twitter.com/madawei2699/status/1481596368716451842
- 他们赚钱的套路就是疯狂开知乎号，写垃圾文（同一篇文排列组合出无数文章），然后找各种问题回复垃圾文，一天能刷十万阅读。文章底部是资料包引流，要解压缩需要关注公众号。
  - 一万知乎阅读引流 50-100 个微信号粉丝，一个月能做 10 个 50 万阅读的号，500 万阅读可以给公众号倒流 5000-1 万粉丝，发到封号为止。1 万粉丝技术号，一个月可以变现 5000，能变现 1 年，之后靠卖课（和大V合作），或知识星球收费。就这样搞死知乎（或者知乎根本不在乎）
- 所以内容营销的秘诀就是不停的发水文，排列组合出无数内容垃圾，只要有流量就行，有人靠写垃圾文年入百万。真正有质量的文章流量却很少，导致此原因的有两方面。公众号广告主只看数据不看质量，所以有流量就行，用户不爱看高质量文章，上班那么累，下班刷水文打发时间。只要有十几万粉丝，比上班赚钱。
  - 这里让我震惊的是排列组合写垃圾文还有人看，以前我以为洗稿或春秋笔法这种行为已经很不齿了，没想到现在已经进化成排列组合简单粗暴这种方式了，更没想到有很多人就是喜欢看这种产物下的内容。
- 互联网逐渐演变为一个巨型内容垃圾场，如何从垃圾场淘金，将是每个新时代网民的必备技能。
- 机核的这篇文章有深度的分析了简中互联网中讨论氛围的消失原因，包括对比微信公众号、豆瓣、新浪微博、知乎平台等对讨论区的结构设计。
  - 结论就是人与人的对话很难脱离各自的局限而平等理性的去探讨问题本身，这不是互联网的问题，也很难从技术上去解决社会学的问题。
- 百度已死，Google正在死😂这篇文章提到了一些有意思的点：
  1. 基于广告的搜索引擎最终会被广告反噬，第一页的位置竞争导致大量内容站为排名而生，为流量而生，信息有没有用不知道，但只要对排名有帮助就做。
  2. 互联网中占比最多的是机器人，真正的用户在 reddit，如果想获取人的观点，请搜索后缀加 reddit
  3. 一个有趣的黑帽SEO网站的故事，无论怎么搜索，此网站在挪威地区的排名都非常高。此网站巧妙的利用了Google的一些弱点：a. 大量的内容 b. 跳出率
- 从上面的故事中得出欺骗Google获取排名的一些套路：
  1. 大量的内容。流量站爬取大量的互联网内容，一般页面超过千万个。通过长尾词获取大量的流量，此时网站的排名不一定高，但有很高的月访问量。
  2. 网站从长尾词获取用户点击后，控制用户无法返回Google从而降低跳出率获取排名。

- ## I'm open-sourcing Actual. I'm sad that I couldn't make it work as a sustainable company
- https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/1520063046101700610
  - The code is very, very messy. I'm not proud of it. It's just  too big for me to spend time cleaning it up.
  - It's a neat artifact though of what it takes to build an ambitious app. You'll see everything in there, raw and unedited.
- orry it didn't work out as a company. I'm building something very much inspired by the Actual architecture and have learned a lot from your posts and talks. Thank you so much for choosing to open-source this. I think it can really help people trying to make local-first apps.

- ## 想起以前创业的时候，公司规模一大，咱被迫也得学点管理学。
- https://twitter.com/xiaoyuz/status/1510839847673491461
  - 其中有个东西我一直印象很深，后来对我帮助也很大，那就是在处理分歧的时候——不管是战略思路、日常运营、人事变动等等等等——都可以记住一个原则：看似两个观点分歧巨大的人，其实他们彼此同意的部分，往往要比他们互相不认同的部分多得多…
  - 换种方式讲，很多时候两方其实对一件事 95% 的看法都一致，但吵的时候就很容易聚焦在那 5% 的地方来回拉扯。但其实那 5% 是很容易通过思辨或者实验，找到比较好的解决方案的。甚至有时候这 5% 根本不是问题的关键，把那 95% 共识的部分弄好，整件事基本就差不多搞定了。
- 后来在工作中我时常利用这个原则来解决团队分歧。比如大家对某件事的执行方案思路不同，我会召集两边团队，让他们先在纸上写下来对这个东西的理解，然后一条一条的，和双方确认「这里说的你们都同意吗」、「这个基础的认识你们理解一致吧」，后来果然发现，争议往往就是最后那 5%，多一点儿都没有。

- ## 我现在想做的东西太多了，因为我技术栈跨度比较大，所以能看到很多机会，也都有能力去做，但是分身乏术，只能选一个做，每个都有风险也都有机会。乱花渐欲迷人眼，反而进入了内耗状态。这种情况该怎么办
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1507167295290118148
- 弄个自由职业者联盟，拉一些风投，投资给自由开发者去开发你的想法
- 当你找到一个愿意终身投入的项目，你就会发现做其他项目都是浪费时间
- 做 10 件 60 分甚至可能不及格的作品，不如做一个💯的。
- 先做可以复用的那个，后续开其他项目可以复用之前的项目，边际成本变低了，产出就会超快。久而久之，会有越来越多的产品，也就是产品矩阵。新的产品可以依赖产品矩阵中原先的产品优势，开新项目的速度会变得越来越快
- 分辨出最有长期价值的，标的是复合趋势的，把别的机会让给后来者，介绍出去给人做
- 我目前就是这种状态，但与你不同的是，很多工作即便我能做，我也会选择外包出去。自己只做决策和运营。
- 用乔布斯的办法，假想你只剩下一年时间，你会做哪个
- 应该想办法把已经做好的卖的更多，不要搞新的了

- ## 6 years ago I joined a 5 person startup. We raised over $54.2M in funding over 5 rounds. Now that company has been sold for parts and all employees are underwater. 
- https://twitter.com/tommoor/status/1497640705434521609

- 6 years ago I joined a 20-person startup.
  - I wanted to quit after my first week, but didn't.
  - Now our company is worth over $1B and has 200+ employees.
  - Here's what I've learned about succeeding at a startup:
- https://twitter.com/bbourque/status/1497563992478257153
  - 1) Startups are HARD. 
  - 2) There's a massive amount of UNCERTAINTY
  - 3) A great founder will challenge you constantly.
  - 4) The leadership team's values are INCREDIBLY important
  - 5) It sucks to miss goals and let people down
  - 6) What you do in year 1 is very different from year 2, year 3, year 4, etc...
  - 7) Be biased to act
    - Small experiments can reveal big insights quickly. 
    - Don’t waste time over-planning / overthinking. 
    - Run lots of small experiments and expect that some will work out.
  - 8) MVP most things.
  - 9) Take risks
  - 10) Nothing is “not my job”. 
  - 11) Show people it’s okay to be wrong
  - 12) Let curiosity carry you.
  - 13) Understanding technical things is very useful. 
  - 14) There's only so much that scrappy people can figure out quickly...
  - 15) Identify your weaknesses

- ## 在 V2ex 看到一个独立开发的哥们，只能说，读书少确实害了他自己，做错了几乎所有事情。得亏是有个好的老婆和岳父，能坚持到现在。
- https://twitter.com/xiqingongzi/status/1493456735180587008
  - 独立开发并非毫无指南，多读书，多看报，会少踩很多坑。不要踩别人踩过的坑。
- 错误1: 没有进行快速上线和推广就持续进行开发。
  - 尚未完成产品的原型和需求验证的情况下，投入数年来开发一个产品，可以说是非常愚蠢了。当然，我知道很多研发同学出来做东西都是这个问题。切忌不可闭门造车。有些东西没人做不是因为只有你慧眼识珠，也可能是你碰上了一个假需求
- 错误2:  ALL IN 一个暂时没有现金流的事情

- ## SaaS 公司的价值: 说实话，即便是我们做了一套很牛的软件产品，也就是“一把不错的铁锹”，卖铁锹给别人，别人挖出来金矿和我们没有任何关系。 我们还是一个卖铁锹的。
- https://twitter.com/ThaddeusJiang/status/1492133196087308289
  - 卖铁锹的，怎么能跟客户的营收有关系呢？我们可以考虑加入到行业的业务层面，帮助客户一起找金矿。给客户挖金矿的方法或者一起运营金矿的业务，这样才能和客户一起分享挖出来的金矿。
  - 等挖金矿的人多了，卖铁锹也赚钱啊。这就相当于做基础设施建设，Figma 还有国内的 Moka 就属于这一类，也赚得钵满盆溢啊。不过你得根据挖金矿的人的需求升级，得做自动挖矿铁锹， 不能一直做铁锹。

- ## I'm going to keep working on @tldraw . I'll be raising money in the new year to build a team and build an open-core platform for spatial canvas apps.
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1468630460305747977
- Turns out everyone like an infinite canvas. 
  - I'm convinced that many of the next great products will be built on "design tool" paradigms—zoomable canvas, direct manipulation, and real-time multiplayer collaboration.
- Bad news: these types of applications are incredibly hard to develop! 
  - Especially for the web, where there are vanishingly few resources and trade-offs everywhere. 
  - It takes a team of experts—and there just aren't enough experts.
- Good news: spatial UI apps are 90% identical, with hundreds of "table stakes" features and services that can be abstracted away, so that a team focus on their domain problems instead of getting stuck on selection logic, arrow binding, or alignment snapping.
- What do you mean by spacial UI? 
  - This one is also sometimes called a "zoom ui", or "infinite canvas". Think miro / mural / figma, etc.

- ## Startup idea. Get really good at state machines. Use them to solve a difficult problem. Sell the solution
- https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1469329372691808263

- ## Let’s talk about funding for open source projects, specifically my thoughts for @tldraw .
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1469978436257169410
  - I get about $2, 000 a month from GitHub sponsors. 
- First off, I like open source for lots of reasons, some more ☭ than others, but the value game is all wrong. 
  - Companies are making millions off of passion projects or casual labor—that’s neither fair nor sustainable.
- For me, open source has been a way of sharing what I like to do, raising my profile as a developer while also sorta paying down some privilege. 
  - It’s great to connect with other “prosumers”, collectively producing the product that we want to use.
- tldraw is my first major open source project, insofar as I’m really building it to be used by other teams; 
  - but, like anything serious, it’s too big to do “on the side” without sacrificing the project’s quality or my own happiness.
- And while GitHub Sponsors has been a great way to help fund it’s early development (thank you) that money doesn’t remotely compare to the salaries I’ve turned down to work on it.
- I see a few options:
- 👉🏻️ 1. Sell time as a consultant for teams using the library. 
  - For me, that would mean taking contacts with teams who need help integrating tldraw or building certain features which I would solve via the open source project.
- 👉🏻️ 2. Build a product around the core library and monetize that product. 
  - For me, this would be the tldraw engine (open) and the tldraw whiteboarding app (open core with new paid services for teams, etc).
- 👉🏻️ 3. Raise VC money and hire a team to work on the project and related products of services, with the goal of gaining wide adoption. 
  - For me, that would mean making tldraw the react/firebase of spatial uis, ie the default dev option, selling things like multiplayer.
- 👉🏻️ 4. Find a corporate sponsor that will hire me to work on the project. 
  - Ideally keep ownership of the project, in case things don’t work out and I decide to pivot to other options.
- 👉🏻️ 6. Get acquihired by a company that does not want to maintain the project, but where I could work on similar problems within the company’s own products. 
  - Not the worst ending for me, but death for the open source project.
- 👉🏻️ 5. Double down on individual contributions. 
  - Focus on content, start putting out YouTube videos, Twitch streams and farm sponsorships. Go very wide.
- They’d all have trade offs, either in my own time, my freedom to set priorities myself, the value I’m able to extract for myself, or the possible scale of the project.
  - Of all, the most comfortable would be acquisition by a company who wants to build on the project, or where it’s success would align with its other business goals.
  - The least comfortable would be relying on sponsorships (content is hard!). Contracting isn’t too far ahead, though I think I could make it work.
- Raising money would mean more pressure to build the product into a business though ideally with a longer runway than doing so myself, and a more ambitious goal with more people involved, and more likelihood of success.
  - It’s pretty hard to strategize! And many conflicting priorities.

- Have you considered selling the product? Replicache uses the bsl license, is developed in the open, like open source and becomes true open source after two years. We don’t have concrete data on how well this works but early signals are good and it directly reflects your goals.
  - I think this is compatible with raising money. The difference I’m getting at is compared to (2): instead of giving away the core and selling something else (a service), just sell the core directly.

- ## Unpopular opinion: an SQLite SaaS would be my pick for anything slow/write fast/read scenario (blogs to name one). Not sure why nothing exists already out there
- https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1476586199251058689
- Can you tell me how important SQL part is, or do you technically need Firebase infra with option to send SQL? Or maybe SQL is not important?
  - any NoSQL library out there looks like knex but is not standard ... which is why I believe SQL is extremely important but, on top of that, I have mentioned SQLite, not any SQL, strictly, truly, SQLite as a remote service that any static page *could* access: no Server needed.
- But if you are using it as SaaS you'd just be using SQL to it, so from your POV there'd be no difference to using some other db like postgresql at the back? (modulo the dialects etc). Same local dev + prod is Hundred points symbol tho. SQLite at lambda/cloudflare workers would be 

- ## I repeat, this is a 100% true story that isn’t about open source but gives a good idea about what it’s like to maintain an open source project. 
- https://twitter.com/slicknet/status/1430334633611202562
  - A lot of people suggest a lot of changes to open source projects not understanding that there is a maintenance cost to every new line of code added.
  - The person coming up with the idea thinks that it’s great because they aren’t the ones that have to maintain it.
- But I think maintainers should teach those who are willing to contribute to the project cause it's easy to suggest but hard to implement so maybe having the right guideline on how the project works and all that can help.

- ## This summer marked four years of working full-time on my own business(Tailwind UI)
- https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1296447318074568704
  - Here are some of the things I believe the most strongly about making a living as an independent maker
- The best way to build an audience is to simply be helpful on the internet. 
  - Give people a reason to pay attention to you, and keep your signal to noise ratio high. 
  - Better to tweet 4 good ideas per week than 10 useful ideas + a bunch of BS about how Starbucks screwed up your order.
- Giving away your work for free is like compressing a spring that releases when you finally put something up for sale. 
  - The longer you do it, the more energy is released. 
  - Steve and I compressed the Refactoring UI spring for over two years. 
  - It made $1, 000, 000 in the first month.
- Marketing doesn’t have to feel gross. 
  - Sharing what you’re working on, writing about the behind-the-scenes process, and documenting hard problems you’ve solved is all marketing, 
  - and people are *excited* to see that sort of stuff, not put off by it.
- Marketing a product after it’s released is way harder than marketing it before you launch. 
  - You need to start marketing at the very beginning, when all of the exciting development is happening and you have lots of interesting things to share.
- Ignoring people who are critical of your work is not “creating an echo chamber”, it’s building a community. 
  - You wouldn’t tell Slayer to write songs for the people who don’t like Slayer. 
  - Find the people who love what you’re doing and spend your attention on them, ignore the rest.
- **Analytics are overrated**. 
  - I’ve never once made a decision that was informed by open rates or traffic sources. 
  - In fact Tailwind UI has no website analytics at all. 
  - Doing great work has always been a more efficient lever for me.
- Build real friendships, not a “network”. 
  - People who want to help you > people you ask to help you. 
  - I’ve never had to ask anyone to help promote my work.
- Work in public. 
  - Tailwind only exists because a bunch of people seemed excited about some boring CSS files I was using when I was live-streaming some work on a completely different project. 
  - I never would have seen the potential on my own.
- Always think long-term. 
  - Early in my entrepreneurial career, I made a lot of short-sighted decisions about time-limited deals, and other urgency/scarcity based marketing strategies. 
  - It made me look like a scummy internet marketer and I will never do that again.
- Pick a “business hero” and ask yourself “would they do this?” whenever you’re trying to make a tough decision about a marketing tactic. 
  - For me it’s Basecamp. 
  - Lots of decisions feel hard for me to make for myself, but are obvious when I ask myself “what would Basecamp do?”
- “Early access” doesn’t have to be cheaper, in fact you can easily make the argument for making it more expensive. 
  - If I wanted to early access to the unmastered recordings of a new album I was looking forward to would that be cheaper?
- A landing page is the last step in validating an idea, not the first. 
  - Put your ideas out there as tweets, articles, videos, conference talks, etc. first and see what people are excited about. 
  - A landing page takes you from 90% confidence in an idea to 95%, not 0% to 100%.
- Compete on quality. 
  - There are tons of people writing blog posts, making screencasts, open sourcing libraries, etc., but very few people making stuff that’s really *great* from end-to-end. 
  - Forget the 80/20 rule when it comes to putting out projects. Go the full 100.
- Stand out by doing the hard work that everyone else is too lazy to do. 
  - For example, @reinink was the 1000th person to write a tutorial on the Eloquent ORM, 
  - but he was the first person to bite off the really *hard* problems and do the grueling work to come up with good answers.
- Learning is more important than your ego. 
  - I ask for help about dumb shit on Twitter all the time, no one thinks I’m stupid and I have grown 100x as a result. 
  - I literally started a podcast just to get people to explain things to me that I didn’t fully understand.

- discussion

- Making money as the first goal was the worst mistake I made in life. Just like you said, people need to be given the result of real work and polished. Thank you, man!
- Here's an honest question: How did you not break financially while developing your own products? Freelancing?
  - I wrote my first book over a three month period just evenings and weekends, and was fortunate enough that the launch made enough money for me to quit and start working on the next thing 
- Could you share the process and tools you used to write your first book please?
  - I wrote it all as one giant markdown file in Sublime Text, then compiled the markdown to HTML with a few custom scripts and turned the markdown into PDF with PrinceXML and a custom stylesheet.
- In case it’s helpful Matthew, I’ve started using ASCIIDoc for my ebooks as it has converters to PDF in most languages.
