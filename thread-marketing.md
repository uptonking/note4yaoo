# pieces

- ## 

- ## Startup idea: A social network (let's call it "the web") where people can post digital art, *but* they first need permission ("a licence") from the artist.
- https://twitter.com/AmeliasBrain/status/1368598410673025025
  - Artists can sell permission in various ways:
  - exclusive to one owner or not
  - transferable or not
  - No chained blocks required
- I'm seeing so many cool digital artists post links to their NFT offerings & as much as I hate the blockchain absurdity of it, I've felt like I couldn't blame people for grabbing some of the cash flying around.

- ## Has anybody built a social network for rich people yet?
- https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1357606986066653185
  - It would only work on the very latest, most expensive iPhone.
  - You'd have to buy new hardware every 6 months to prove you are wealthy
- [I Am Rich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich) is an iOS application developed by Armin Heinrich and which was distributed using the App Store.
  - I Am Rich was sold on the App Store for US$999.99 
  - The application was removed from the App Store without explanation by Apple Inc. the day after its release, August 6, 2008

- ## Singapore is pretty great¹ for indie hackers
- https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1355099275252785153
  - No corporate tax up to $100k/yr
  - No sales tax on Int'l Services (incl digital goods)
  - No auditor needed <$1m
  - Took 30 mins and $300 to register co and open bank account!
- Estonia is pretty damn good too and no local residency requirement (I think you can get around it in Singapore, but they're obviously not as keen as Estonia)
- i dont think CXO title is meaningful for companies under 50 people
- Singapore corporate tax exemption is for new companies. Your first 3 years of business only. Still, it’s a nice perk.

- ## Today I'm open sourcing the code that I've made $500K off of
  - https://twitter.com/_rchase_/status/1334619345935355905
  - I want everyone to see how bad it is, 

    - and I hope it inspires someone out there who is worried that they're not a good enough programmer to be able to start a SaaS business.
    - Unfortunately, I don't have time to individually mentor everyone in my DMs
    - Good news is no one individually mentored me either

  - Hint: The next HostiFi won't be built by someone forking this and starting another UniFi cloud hosting service.

    - Start something new. Put your ideas through the meat grinder
    - I think we do well at this in our market. Unlike our competition, we don't just do IT support. 
    - We innovate new solutions and new products for our customers that even our competitors occasionally end up using (or their clients do at least)
    - you’ll be competing with dozens of others (maybe hundreds after this tweet), all racing to the bottom to be “the cheaper HostiFi”

  - I almost gave up and didn't launch HostiFi because I felt I wasn't a good enough programmer. 

    - I was trying to write it with Django and couldn't get it working, 
    - but I kept trying different things until I finally made it work with WordPress and these 2 files.

  - While I know there isn't likely a single answer here, how'd you get your initial couple dozen customers?

    - TLDR; tried lots of stuff, still doing lots of stuff. 
    - First 6 months I didn't get any organic search traffic, after that started to rank 1st page Google for relevant terms like "UniFi cloud hosting"

  - how you come up with this idea ? Have you ever been in networking field already, or faced problem with ubiquiti devices? And what your idea bring as benefits to the users ? 

    - Yes it was “scratch my own itch” 
    - I had discovered the problem because it was something I wanted to do. 
    - I was installing UniFi networks as an IT consultant and wanted to manage them all from one cloud server, but it took a while to figure out how to do it.
    - I had an IT service business on the side and was installing UniFi lots of places, 
    - it didn't make sense to me to buy a Cloud Key every time or manage multiple installs when I could centralize it to one cloud server.
