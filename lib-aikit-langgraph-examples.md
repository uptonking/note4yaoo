  - Graphiti is used to personalize agent responses based on information learned from prior conversations
  - Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs
  - A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected facts. 
  - Each fact is a "triplet" represented by two entities, or nodes ("Kendra", "Adidas shoes"), and their relationship, or edge ("loves"). 
  - Graphiti powers the core of Zep

- https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-agent-platform /1.6kStar/MIT/202508/ts
  - https://oap.langchain.com/
  - open-source, no-code agent building platform.
  - Open Agent Platform provides a modern, web-based interface for creating, managing, and interacting with LangGraph agents.
  - RAG Integration: First-class support for Retrieval Augmented Generation with LangConnect.
  - Agent Supervision: Orchestrate multiple agents working together through an Agent Supervisor.
  - Authentication: Built-in authentication and access control.
  - An agent is a custom configuration on-top of an existing LangGraph graph. This is the same concept as an `assistant`, in the LangGraph API.
  - OAP does not require a standalone backend server to be running in order for the web app to work. However, if you want to use the RAG features, you will need to have the LangConnect server running on its own. 
  - All agents you intend to use with OAP must be LangGraph agents, deployed on LangGraph Platform.

  - https://flows-ai.callstack.com/
  - A lightweight, type-safe AI workflow orchestrator inspired by Anthropic's agent patterns. 
  - Built on top of Vercel AI SDK.
  - Last year, we built Fabrice - an AI agent framework designed to break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
  - We realized that AI agent systems today are essentially modern workflows where each node is an LLM call instead of a traditional function. 
  - The key difference lies not in the framework, but in the nature of these nodes: they have flexible input/output contracts.
  - This insight led us to redefine our approach and focus on an orchestration, so you can connect different (often incompatible input/outputs) together.
  - This library provides a simple, more deterministic way to build AI workflows. You can either explicitly define your workflow with loops and conditionals, or use an orchestrator agent to dynamically break down complex tasks.
