- v0.10.0 - Better Docs Management, Staged Rollouts (2023-09-08)
  - üìÑ The main addition in this update is better docs support. This means you can add and remove docs and inspect the urls that are actually being used for each doc you have uploaded.

  - Diff/Generate improvements

- v0.2.0 (2023-04-06) - migrate from codemirror to vscode
  - üö® To focus on delivering the most advanced AI features at lightning speed, we‚Äôve transitioned to building Cursor on top of a fork of VSCodium, moving away from our previous Codemirror-based approach
  - we think programming with Cursor look be entirely different than coding today.
  - In order to achieve this transformation as quickly as possible, we‚Äôre focusing our efforts on enhancing the AI, rather than reinventing the wheel for standard text editing features. Building on the phenomenal foundation of VSCode/VSCodium will help us achieve this goal at a rapid pace

- v0.1.2-0.1.3 (2023-03-18)
  - Built-in terminal
  - Diffs automatically continue
  - Can open chat history from the prompt bar

- v0.0.37 (2023-03-14)
  - Windows and Linux support
  - Editing works for same file on multiple tabs
