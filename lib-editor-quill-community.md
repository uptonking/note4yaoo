- ## ðŸŽ¯ [What Quill version to use?](https://github.com/quilljs/quill/issues/3356)
  - 1.3.7 which is installed from npm by npm install quill and was published 2 years ago.
  - 2.0.0-dev3 - this version is required for modules quill-better-table and quill-table-ui . It was published 3 years ago (???).
  - 2.0.0-dev4 - this version I found in npm versions history. It was published a year ago
- it looks like dead from current 1.1k open issues, and this Contributors Insights: 2013-2017 were the most active days, and since 2019 very low development activities
