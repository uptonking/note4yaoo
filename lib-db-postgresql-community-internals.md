- ## [sql: support NOTIFY, LISTEN, and UNLISTEN commands of postgresql ¬∑ Issue ¬∑ cockroachdb/cockroach _201910](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/41522)
  - PostgreSQL has support for NOTIFY, LISTEN, and UNLISTEN commands which generate and listen for a notification, respectively. 
  - This is not a part of SQL standard; however, some ORMs (like go-pg) seems to be using it.

- ## How does Postgres decide when to use an index? Depends.

- ## Postgres is an amazing database. It‚Äôs only significant weakness now is in Materialized views, with their lack of incremental refresh._202207
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32097663
  - Was disappointing to see there was no progress towards this in v15.
- That work towards incrementally updated views is happening and progressing. 
  - For now, it's a separate extension, though: https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm
- I wanted incremental refresh in Postgres as well and found that you can manage your own table to get something close.
  - Basically you create a regular table in place of a materialised one, only aggregate data newer than what's currently in the table then store the new aggregates in table. Repeat this an interval.
- Interestingly, DBT does not support creating materialized views.

- ## ‚ÄúWhy is Postgres seq-scanning rather than use this index?‚Äù
- https://x.com/gwenshap/status/1928139754287333641
  - Short answer: the planner thinks that index won‚Äôt help (or can‚Äôt use it).

1Ô∏è‚É£ Stale stats: ANALYZE hasn‚Äôt run; filter looks un-selective.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Truly un-selective: Stats are right; scan really is cheaper.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Complex estimates: Many joins / ORs / CTE / functions scramble row estimates.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Handcuffs on: RLS limits optimizations or GUCs forbid the path.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Planner bugs: Very rare but...

- Debug flow:
  - ANALYZE ‚ûú rethink predicate ‚ûú simplify query ‚ûú audit policies & GUCs ‚ûú If still wrong, try pg_hint_plan (force an index to prove a point) or hypopg (hypothetical indexes) before filing a bug.

- ## PostgreSQL implements an interesting optimization to make some scans index-only and execute the query faster. Let's explore the implementation.
- https://x.com/arpit_bhayani/status/1846754739762901454
  - An index-only scan is when PostgreSQL retrieves data entirely from the index without needing to access the actual rows (the heap). This is much faster as it avoids the extra step of reading rows from the disk.

- ## Like most databases, Postgres work with fixed size pages. 
- https://x.com/hnasr/status/1832071246051446991
  - Those pages are 8K in size, each page will have the rows, or index tuples and a fixed header. The pages are just bytes in files and they are read and cached in the buffer pool.
  - If a table has 100 pages, to do a full table scan, we would be making close to 100 system read calls, taking kernel read-ahead in to consideration. 
  - Postgres 17 now combines I/Os to retrieve multiple pages at once. This leads to fewer system calls and lower read latency.

- ## Postgres code has this habit of making some code 1-based indexed and some 0-based indexed.
- https://twitter.com/eatonphil/status/1725572175292158096
  - For example, in a query: to find the relation (table, in simple cases) being referred to, you get a 1-based index. To look up that relation in the list of relations it's 0-based.
- I'm still not used to Postgres arrays being 1-based.

- CouchDB uses sequential UUID by default
  - the choice of UUID has a significant impact on the layout of the B-tree, prior to compaction.
