# 💰 [pricing](https://github.com/orgs/nocodb/projects/13/views/2)

- [What is available in free version ?](https://docs.nocodb.com/faqs/#what-is-available-in-free-version-)

- 🆚️ NocoDB has just one version that is free & open source.
  - In it you will notice advanced features are all available for free
  - ACL; Collaboration; Views; Share; protected; Automations
  - And we would never move these features from free to an enterprise version of NocoDB.
  - There is no limitations to number of projects, records or fields either.

- Do we plan to have an Enterprise Edition?
  - SSO, SLA, Organisation wide reports and analytics, 
  - Advanced Audit or ACL, 
  - Bespoke implementations & integrations, 
  - A hosted solution.

- How do we decide if a feature is Enterprise or not ?
  - Depends on the effort and whether the intended users are enterprises.
