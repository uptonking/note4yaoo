  - It looks like it's heavily inspired maybe slightly changed React Native for Web.
  - As I checked source code, it really looks like RNfW revamped for web only. So much goodness there.
- React Native for Web is React Native for web. react-gui seems to be React Native for Web for web only.
- react-gui seems to be less strict React Native for Web.
