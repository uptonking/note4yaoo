# lib-ui-react-gui-community

# discuss-stars

- ## What is react-gui?
- https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/71
- This is a personal experiment I moved to a FB repo to share with colleagues. 
  - There is no official relationship with React. 
  - We are experimenting with it in a few places at FB in a very limited way, and at this stage there are no current plans for a publicly supported release. 
  - Some ideas from it have been feeding back into React Native for Web and discussed with the React Native team, 
  - but it's too early to say whether this will become anything more.

  - It looks like it's heavily inspired maybe slightly changed React Native for Web.
  - As I checked source code, it really looks like RNfW revamped for web only. So much goodness there.
- React Native for Web is React Native for web. react-gui seems to be React Native for Web for web only.
- react-gui seems to be less strict React Native for Web.
