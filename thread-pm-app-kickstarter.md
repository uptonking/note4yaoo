- ## Harsh truth: Reading about other successful creators won't make you one. 
- https://twitter.com/mkhundmiri/status/1383688592099135498
  - Start creating so that you have your own success story to tell.

- ## ❌️ Learn and Build. ✅️ Build in order to learn. 
- https://twitter.com/tanaypratap/status/1423924948611977217
  - Don’t wait to know everything before you build something out. 
  - Build with whatever you know and you’ll end up learning as a side effect.

- ## Too many projects and ideas, not enough time!
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1389725014379823107
- Lay down the roadmap. Check if people are interested in building that. Instead of idea it will become something
- I wish I could say that too.. I have time for now but no enough knowledge yet
- No project ideas. Only problem
  - make a project to solve your problem

- ## Monetizing OSS is difficult by nature, but I hope people will pay if they find a value. 
- https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1489205927542591488
  - It's more meaningful to pay for a content, instead of tipping for OSS. So, I decided to challenge. 
  - This is my first paid content to teach the library code, Zustand.
- [Build your own state management library for React (zustand-like)](https://rohitpotato.hashnode.dev/build-your-own-state-management-library-for-react)

- ## WebVM
- https://webvm.io/
- https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm
  - WebVM is a server-less virtual Linux environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. 
  - In this demo, it runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.
  - WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser.
  - CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator.

- ## ar5iv
- https://ar5iv.org/
- Articles from arXiv.org as responsive HTML5 web pages.
  - Converted from TeX with LaTeXML.
  - Sources upto the end of 2021. Not a live preview service.
- https://twitter.com/khinsen/status/1488415031972843526
  - You can download / archive them, and convert them to EPub for better reading (via pagination) on an e-ink device. No offline reading though, because of @MathJax .
  - For long-term archiving, better stick to the PDF files from arXiv. That is the weak point of HTML-based scholarly publishing.
  - 
- https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML
  - LaTeXML is a TeX & LaTeX to XML, HTML, MathML, ePub, JATS, ... converter.
  - 实现语言为perl

- ## So when does @GitHub copilot SEO officially start?
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1461706183799189509
  - Keywords are now code comments, 
  - search results are now code snippets, 
  - core web vitals is how often your snippets are used in high profile public codebases.

- Especially considering that code is a very viable part of a content mix (in dev marketing at least)

- ## Remotion Success Story!
- https://twitter.com/JNYBGR/status/1438444378482221062
  - With http://MakeStories.io you can use drag and drop to create Google Web Stories, and with the Remotion-powered rendering engine, export them as MP4 as well!

- ## I know of like 9 companies trying to build their own internal in-house Vercel-like platform on AWS. 
- https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1386411683074101248
  - Huge opportunity for an ambitious open source project or consultancy.
- https://github.com/getmeli/meli
  - platform for deploying static sites and frontend applications.
- https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify
  - self-hostable Heroku & Netlify alternative
- Our(Vercel) answer to this is continuing to invest in advanced Enterprise features: "bring your own" CI, VPC peering, more resource isolation features on the horizon. 
  - We're thrilled so many govt, fintech, and healthcare customers are enjoying the @vercel platform already.
  - More broadly… building, maintaining, securing and operating your frontend & global edge infrastructure is hard, undifferentiated stuff.
  - The big question is whether folks *should* focus on this instead of investing in their app experiences.

- ##  I found Notion is the one-stop solution for all note-taking purposes 
- https://twitter.com/iamrohitgund/status/1325229159027630080
  - but only one problem I faced is that I can't copy tables to Microsoft Word or other platforms. 
  - If there is any way to do that I can shift 100% from Evernote, Microsoft To-do, etc
- Our(Notion's) tables are databases, not spreadsheets, so there's some fundamental differences compared to other programs.
  - That being said, you should be able to copy + paste into a spreadsheet. 
  - You can also export content as .csv!

- ## Time for the annual "What are people using to blog these days?" question. 
- https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/1389585490412818440
  - I think I want to just use plain HTML at this point. 
  - Or maybe something pre-made that generates HTML.
  - I definitely don't want to maintain yet another code base.
- Jekyll, for the last 5 years or so. Just a bunch of markdown files and a template.

- ## Turn your github issues into a CMS for your blog
- https://twitter.com/renatorib_/status/1387496644158033922
  - https://github.com/renatorib/github-blog
  - 依赖graphql，不依赖react
- Imagine doing a template repo based on this library.
  - It renders HTML using a vercel cloud function with given cache time or using github actions on a secondary branch.
  - You fork it, setup the PAT and HTML template, setup vercel to deploy the repo and start posting.
  - I'm doing it XD. It's actually a starter template using next
- I was thinking about a cloud function generated HTML with Cache-Control fetching comments asynchronously on load but NextJS can even fit better for this.
  - Basically what NextJS do almost out of the box with SSG XD

- ## JavaScript based projects ideas
1.  URL Shortener
2.  Whether App
3.  Todo App
4.  YouTube Web Player
5.  Stock Website
6.  Portfolio website
7.  Video conferencing app
8.  Web based terminal
9.  Browser code editor
- Pro Tip: Host these projects on AWS, and push the code to GitHub.

- ## I seriously love this Github comment feature
- https://twitter.com/LukyVJ/status/1385164657007149058

```suggestion
your suggestion here 
```

- I only wish it worked well with nested fenced code blocks (e.g., when suggesting to add a Markdown code example). I suspect it’s parsed with a lazy regular expression.
  - you can add an extra ` to the outer one. it's in the spec
  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-95
- This has 100% changed the way we do code reviews and it's amazing. If only GitHib could also lint/Prettier the suggestions before committing them though.

- ## The next frontier in product design tools is in making prototypes/designs/sketches that are NOT disposable - that are coupled with the platform they describe.
- https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1385153436954546177
  - In other words, imagine making a PR to your repo from Figma/Excalidraw.
- Imagine a design tool that could:
  - PR a failing test to your repo that passes when you complete the work it describes.
  - Create application flows driven by 'typed holes' that the developer fills in.

- ## Things web apps can do by default that I wish native apps could do, too:
- https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1383350431619837955
  - Zoom in anywhere
  - Copy any UI text
  - Clone the current view(open the current page in new tab)
  - Bookmark the current location
- May I add?
  - allow for script blocking (ads, tracking etc)
  - allow for loading custom stylesheets (reader mode, dark mode, accessibility - this requires a bit technical knowledge on HTML/CSS)
  - allow for being consumed on any device (even via terminal!)
- Android 11 can copy any text, but it's not really pretty.
  - Note: you must be in app switcher mode (app not maximized) to enable text selection.

- ## Every repo, issue, commit, etc will get a generated card like it.
- https://twitter.com/JasonEtco/status/1380194813140725761
  - And an even more special card for issues, PRs or commits!
- This is sweet. Visual + text is a great way to help people engage and not miss important information.
- I believe we'll be doing a larger blog post about it soon, but we use Puppeteer to generate a screenshot from some HTML.
  - Just out of curiosity: wouldn't something like a Canvas with html2canvas for Example be faster or more efficient Memory wise? Nice Idea btw! Love it!
- I did an open-source server for doing that exact thing some time ago
  - https://github.com/micheleriva/gauguin
  - High performances Golang server for generating open graph images dynamically. 
- I just had a look at how the @vercel team did it in their OG img generator and it’s also Puppeteer and headless chromium
  - https://github.com/vercel/og-image

- ## If you use Next.js, what is your favourite part about it?
- https://twitter.com/heybereket/status/1378889849235775489
- Speed, fast refresh, next/image, SSR, ISR!
- The examples folder on GitHub. Every important OS project should have sth like that

- ## I'm so glad I used MDX for my blog. 
- https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau/status/1243136771652751360
  - It enables things that otherwise would not be possible with Markdown or a CMS, while still being a consumable data source (unlike having the posts be all-JSX)
- I created an `<Asterisk>` component because I wanted to add XKCD-style "jokes on hover". 
  - Plus, I tend to be very verbose, and this means I can pack some of that away into an opt-in annotation.
  - For tangential information, I have a `Sidenote` component. It has a `title` prop which accepts JSX, so I can use any special formatting within it. Also a `type` which accepts info/warning/error/success.
  - For code snippets, I built a little playground component on top of react-live. You can pass props using the typical Markdown code-snippet syntax. 
  - Because animated GIFs tend to be huge, I use "video GIFs", similar to social media platforms. I created a component for this, and allowed it to support both `light` and `dark` variants, to swap out the src depending on the user's color theme.
  - The examples I'm showing are JSX-heavy, which might give you the wrong idea. For the most part, my blog posts look like any other Markdown doc.
- Because HTML is valid Markdown I like using Web Components to do the same thing. 

- ## cascading data updates
- https://twitter.com/chris_whong/status/1376626993614184452
  - Wouldn't it be rad if you could tell a dataset to check its source data every hour and create an updated version of itself if there are changes?

- ## A map quiz for this month's #ironquest - Game
- https://twitter.com/ShijiaWendy/status/1376465383813615620
  - [island shape quiz](https://public.tableau.com/views/IslandShapeQuiz/STARTDB?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link&:showVizHome=no)
- I had much fun playing with @Mapbox to make those patterns.

- ## Mermaid for Markdown is not only supported on GitHub but also in #VSCode it seems - code on left, preview on right 
- https://twitter.com/_s_hari/status/1376353291525881864
- Correction: Mermaid is supported on #AzureDevOps. 

- ## I would pay so so so much money for a Figma-based service in that:
- https://twitter.com/Allan/status/1375975277294055425
  - Adds something like tailwind and/or syncs tailwind.config.js as a Figma design system.
  - Exports frames as usable React components. Down to linking Figma symbols to JSON coming out of a fetch or axios.

- ## I just published an introduction to the @jsonstat toolkit as a notebook
- https://twitter.com/badosa/status/1375212974592421889
- This notebook shows you the main features of the jsonstat-toolkit using data from different official statistics providers like Eurostat, UNECE
  - https://observablehq.com/d/22fc6d7389380799
  - JSON-stat is a simple lightweight JSON dissemination(传播, 散布) format best suited for data visualization, mobile apps or open data initiatives, that has been designed for all kinds of disseminators.

- ## I'm really excited to announce Serenity Notes
- https://twitter.com/nikgraf/status/1374619720842944513
  - It's an end-to-end encrypted collaborative notes app allowing you to compose private & shared notes.
  - Think of a simple Google Docs, but end-to-end encrypted and offline-first.
  - and forgot to mention that the client/app code is open source
  - https://github.com/SerenityNotes/serenity-notes-clients
- Is it built on top of a decentralized protocol like  scuttlebutt.nz?
  - I initially started out building it on top of the Matrix Protocol, but hit some roadblocks and eventually went a level deeper directly building a custom protocol on top of gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm
  - It's still very much inspired by parts of the Matrix Protocol, but no federation atm
  - I would love to see it go decentralised by default and a backup to dropbox/drive by choice 
  - Encrypted backups to iCloud/GDrive are one of the next things on the roadmap
- pure CRDTs? how did you solve for undo/redo? checkpoints for docs with lots of changes?
  - I'm using https://github.com/yjs/yjs and this is the true magic behind the editor. 
- Desktop/web version is planning?
  - Yeah, started working on a Desktop (macOS) version and after that would focus on Windows.
  - Web would be great, but there are certain security implications and also the offline-first part is hard. So not planning to do this anytime soon.

- ## I'm super impressed by the approach @craftdocsapp is taking to data ownership. 
- https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1374144532976168967
  - 提出了制定markdown在线多人共同编辑协议的建议
  - At the same time, I think they're hitting the limits of modern data storage platforms, and hinting at precisely why we need a new kind of "collaborative filesystem".
- As context, Craft is an iOS/Mac notetaking app w/ a "blocks" model that feels inspired by Notion.
  - Unlike Notion it's offline-first (= very fast!). 
  - The interesting thing is they offer two different ways to store your data
- Option 1 is to sync your notes to Craft's servers.
  - The benefit of this is you get realtime collaboration, and you can share a web link with anyone to get comments. 
  - Feels similar to GDocs/Notion, just with much better offline mode.
- Option 2 is to store data on your filesystem. 
  - The benefit here is data ownership: more privacy, and you can open the files in other apps without issue.
- Now, if you want sync with Option 2, you can bring your own w/ iCloud Drive etc. But if two devices edit concurrently, you'll hit conflicts.
  - They currently store data in a JSON format but are trying to move to Markdown as a canonical storage format. Would make the "data ownership" even more meaningful since you could just edit their files w/ any Markdown editor!
- So, to review -- user gets to choose either Option 1 or 2 for any note. Which is already amazing and beyond most other apps!
  - But... it's also annoying that I have to choose. Could we have an Option 3 where we get the best of both worlds?
  - Concretely, what I want is something like a "filesystem", where I own the data and can open it in whatever app I choose.
  - But I don't want manual conflict merging every time two people simultaneously edit a doc. The "filesystem" needs to know how to merge changes.
- In other words: why does Craft (and Figma and GDocs and Notion and Pitch...) have to implement their own custom realtime sync protocol?
  - Could we just have a user-owned "filesystem" that deals w/ that part? So I can open a file in multiple apps, and have them sync in realtime?
- **The world I'm imagining** is one where I have Craft open, and you have Notion open, and another collaborator has VSCode open and we're all editing the same document live, perhaps from slightly different perspectives.
  - Curious if people think this "new collaborative filesystem" would be valuable and what the biggest challenges are.
  - To me, feels like the biggest tension is standardizing vs. diverging "file formats", and seeing how much common ground can be found between apps.
- Some intriguing projects which are taking on aspects of this challenge:
  - Braid (braid.org), a generic protocol for state sync
  - Fission (fission.codes), platform for building apps where users own the data
- The original local-first article from I&S is always worth a re-read for thinking about this tradeoff space.
  - But I think the extra tricky part is going beyond "individual devs should do local-first" to "we should have a cross-app local-first FS"
- I believe that future is possible with event sourcing. @todoist somewhat done this with their sync API.
- As long as we have:
  - websocket/web etc
  - ordered list of events 
  - SDK that convert events to data

- ## What are y’all using for for team collaboration on documents, product specs, etc beside Notion? I’m looking for something faster and less clunky than Notion.
- https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1373788153207734275
- Ditto. Notion has made me appreciate Google Docs. Next up Dropbox Paper.
- Confluence, but it's definitely not faster or less clunky than Notion Face with tears of joy

- ## prototyping a tool for messing with data
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1362609484519014400
  - https://github.com/paulshen?tab=repositories&type=source
  - non-live panes (eg side effects like network requests)
  - promise values
  - pop-out expression
  - I'm trying an experiment where all the code lives in one file. see how long til i break
  - main inspiration was an interactive curl | jq
- I think there's also interesting territory to explore around not directly coding the transformation, but instead just demonstrating it "directly on the data"...
- https://github.com/stedolan/jq
  - Command-line JSON processor 
- One dream GUI builder I imagine is like:
  - Reshape from API response into the JSON underlying your UI, in something like your demo tool
  - Style the data into an actual UI in something like this:
- I've been jamming on this concept for making data-driven designs. 
  - Given some JSON, this app will provide you with an interface to describe how you want each entry styled, allowing you to gradually create a more complicated design. Here I create an airbnb-ish app.
  - So the controls make it look a lot like other "no-code" solutions like @webflow , but I think the data-first approach makes it a pretty different experience, perhaps more suitable for apps than for say landing pages.

- ## What are people using for versioned controlled diagrams/flow charts/ etc these days?  Is graphviz/plantuml still the goto?
- https://twitter.com/mat4nier/status/1369769536816226306
- I’ve gotten _really_ good at Graphviz. There’s a PlantUML plugin for Confluence, btw
- plantuml and mermaid mostly

- ## best software to create sequence diagrams like this?
- https://twitter.com/sseraphini/status/1369996346493652995
- I use plantuml for my docs diagrams. 
  - Not the slickest or most modern-looking results, but does the job well and the diagrams are text files that can be put under source control which is nice.
- Write them using mermaid syntax for better version control
- Visual Paradigm.

- ## I'm happy to announce, that basetools.io is in beta! 
- https://twitter.com/sebastianhoitz/status/1369390750404927490
  - It is a paywall for your Github repository or npm package. 
  - Just connect to GitHub, set a price, and charge for access to your repository.
- You can think of it as Gumroad but specifically targeting developers selling their UI components, frameworks, starter templates, or libraries.
  - I think there are huge opportunities for developers to sell their projects and earn a living this way. Lots of exciting projects getting started, too. 
  - People like @adamwathan or @mxstbr are leading the way. I'm sure there is going to be plenty more.
  - I want to support developers with basetools.io by basically taking care of a lot of the barriers to this: Charging money, making sure it has the correct taxes, writing invoices, granting access only to people that paid - This is what we do.
- This could go really well or really, really bad. 
  - Hopefully it doesn't turn into a situation like the Unity Asset Store where folks reskin libraries simply looking to profit. 
  - There could be an explosion of low quality libraries that only serve to add confusion.
- What's the difference between this and GumHub by @m1guelpf ?
  - Sell access to your GitHub repos with Gumroad
