# ideas-stars
- ## 找不到自己的在未来的位置了。
- https://twitter.com/dotey/status/1641851405584433171
  - 不用想那么多，就问自己一个问题：“我是不是能持续创造价值？”，至于使用代码还是AI还是其他方式，没有那么重要

- ## 常看常新：AI 代替的是不会用 AI 的人
- https://twitter.com/novoreorx/status/1635910088123875329

- ## 我觉得自己能力提高了，对于“折腾”这种事，感觉不值。
- https://twitter.com/tualatrix/status/1635095770436374529
  - 所以不打算折腾了。把有限的时间投入到更高价值的事情上去。

- ## Harsh truth: Reading about other successful creators won't make you one. 
- https://twitter.com/mkhundmiri/status/1383688592099135498
  - Start creating so that you have your own success story to tell.

- ## ❌️ Learn and Build. ✅️ Build in order to learn. 
- https://twitter.com/tanaypratap/status/1423924948611977217
  - Don’t wait to know everything before you build something out. 
  - Build with whatever you know and you’ll end up learning as a side effect.

- ## Too many projects and ideas, not enough time!
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1389725014379823107
- Lay down the roadmap. Check if people are interested in building that. Instead of idea it will become something
- I wish I could say that too.. I have time for now but no enough knowledge yet
- No project ideas. Only problem
  - make a project to solve your problem

- ## 可以说这个阶段，idea 是最不值钱的东西了。
- https://twitter.com/Tisoga/status/1639180877187145730
  - ChatGPT Plugin 的 idea 相信大家应该都想到过，几周前我们也做了一个内部的 demo 版本，但是这件事如果是 OpenAI 官方直接下场做就不太一样了，它可以更好地建立整个生态的规范。
  - 创业者应该避免和 OpenAI 正面竞争，侧面赛道还是有非常多可以做的事的。
  - 另外一点就是实际去做真的很重要，只有真的 build 了才能获得最真实的体感，一群人讨论半天 idea 不如直接去 write some code 验证一下（实在不行可以让 GPT-4 帮你写代码验证）。 这批能够跑出来的 startup 一定是那些能够保持探索、持续迭代、快速 pivot 的团队。
- Copilot Hub 现在还在快速迭代中，我们基本上会以天级别来 ship 新的功能 & 修复 bugs。
  - 在上个 Sprint 中 close 了 52 个 issue
- 其实不管现在门槛有多低了，我始终认为：产品力这个东西，还是很重要的。不管2B还是2C，拥有良好产品力的产品，还是有生命力的。而2B市场的玩法就更稳重一下，大家完全可以不用太受openai影响，安心思考怎么做好现在所有业务流程中的copilot，甚至考虑再造一下流程

- ## 大概十年前，我就隐约发现了企业信息化建设的终局：
- https://twitter.com/jamella_hoshino/status/1522537813014634496
  - 不管怎么吹erp或者oa或者crm或者bi或者是别的什么高大上的系统，最终都会回归到两个功能：
  1. 从excel导入数据
  2. 把数据导出成一个excel

- 中间差了一步数据处理
  - 老板：什么数据处理？不就是增删改查么？再写几个复合SQL语句，居然要花这么多钱？！
  - 我还没提可视化
  - 仍然是老板：excel上就能生成很多图啊，不要老是要重复发明轮子！

- 这是产品设计尤其是UI设计的巨大失败。用户宁可在Excel看数据，也不愿意在界面上看数据。
  - Excel是世界顶级软件公司赖以生存的基础之一，1GB多大小的软件专门用来看数据、处理数据，标准统一、易于分享、有庞大的用户群体及使用技巧，哪个界面能比他强大？类似的，再强大的UI，打印也要PDF，除非能说服所有打印机厂商。

- 所以我最近做了一个尝试，将公司的一些数据流的东西直接使用谷歌表格做后端存储服务，然后对表头部分做好格式保护。感觉不还不错。你不就是要表格么？一个链接就搞定了
- 你以为：智慧城市、城市大脑、云上xx
  - 实际上：大屏！大屏！！大屏！！！
- OA=工作翻倍，流程线下一遍+线上一遍。
  - 因为这东西初衷就不是为了底层办事人员方便，而是为了业务留记录方便管理层统计追溯
- 对用户来说，公司里建设投入小于一千万的所谓大数据系统都干不过EXCEL
- 在OA领域做过好几年的开发实施，曾经有用户抱怨过，我原来找领导签字，现在用你们这个系统，我已经好久没见过领导了。对她来说，这是弊端，因为她需要各种借口去找领导。一些常见OA的功能模块并无用处，比如车辆管理、会议室管理、易耗品领用。但是OA审批还是比线下纸件快的多
  - 还有，某甲方领导和我说，没系统的时候，各部门买电脑的申请送来，大多数时候直接通过，有了系统，很方便看看该部门买过多少台电脑，是不是够用了。

- ## 创业公司如何面对竞争 
- https://twitter.com/Tisoga/status/1729398498590933428
  - Paul Graham 给的建议是：ignore competitors; just make something people want.
  - 专注创造价值。

- ## Chamjo —— App 截图收集
- https://twitter.com/ftium4/status/1733530186405269792
  - https://chamjo.design/
  - 收集了 500 多张 App 截图，网站声称以亚洲 App 为主，但中国 App 很少，可能和网站作者是印度尼西亚人有关。

- ## 为小猫设计的抓鱼游戏，平板上
- https://twitter.com/bearbig/status/1730664693961028095
- 我家猫一掌拍上去怕是屏幕不保

- ## My little AI Girlfriend site just hit $500k ARR. 
- https://twitter.com/enias/status/1729458928897912853
  - Just 4 months ago, I dropped everything to go all in.
- What do you charge a month?
  - That's public information though 😅 Played with pricing a lot. 60-40 split between $15 and $35 per month.
  - Biggest advice: Don't think too much about pricing. Just put it online. I found that changing 1 single word can boost your revenue by 20%. For me: "Deluxe" + "Selfie"
- Did you use specialized datasets to make it more attractive than normal GPT speaking?
  - OSS models already do that for ya.

- ## 最会洗厕所的机器人
- https://twitter.com/0xthefool/status/1730461133683978476
- 天生自带流量
- 一个机器人的成本和维护成本能给一个保洁员开两年工资的那种吗？
- 家政的话大众点评阿姨79一次嘎嘎干净，一个月四次也才320

- ## http://devv.ai 原本是我们团队内部使用的一个工具，方便我们更加快速地处理 coding 过程中的问题，以此来代替 Google / StackOverflow / 文档。
- https://twitter.com/Tisoga/status/1729686270941778103
- 非常棒的产品。做对了一件事：解决中文互联网在技术领域的信息质量问题。  这是很大的一件事。
- 产品很棒。这种单一结果还是需要加强准确性/严谨性

- ## 发现一个很不错的标注插件「Glasp」，
- https://twitter.com/HiTw93/status/1645939789907075079
  - 可以在 Twitter、Youtube 、各种网页看到的内容标注和注释，并通过 AI 总结，还可同步 Kindle 上标注的内容。
  - 对于不喜欢做笔记的同学，可以从官网看到大量他人公开标注的好内容，这反而是我觉得这个工具最牛逼的地方。

- ## 聊天，感觉适合小团队的最好的生意是 dbt、vercel（以及未来可能类似 langchain 的托管服务）这种... 
- https://twitter.com/fleuria__/status/1642823157601140738
  - 售卖的是抽象，大厂懒得设计适合中小团队或者个体开发者的抽象，但是一旦社区接受了抽象你的切换成本会巨高...
- 感觉最好先有社区

- ## 微软 Office 全家桶，简直了，帮助微软赢得了桌面电脑的战争，又帮助微软转型移动互联网，又帮助微软成功转型云计算服务，成为SaaS第一巨头，现在又帮助微软转型AI。
- https://twitter.com/uptonking2/status/1636608874173317120
  - Office之于微软，相当于金箍棒之于悟空。
- 这就是一个紧紧抓住用户刚需，建起深广的护城河，然后不断革新产品，跑赢时代和技术变迁的最成功商业案例。
- 最牛的其实是 Outlook，我还没见过不用 Outlook 的职场人。
- Excel 最牛是对马仔来说的，Outlook 对老板最重要，当然如今 Teams 有赶超之势……

- ## ai teacher
- https://twitter.com/ThaddeusJiang/status/1636255620348411907
  - 用户找ai老师
  - 老师将经验交给ai

- ## 广大新能源车机也不开放开发者平台，现在最需要接入 GPT 的就是车机系统的语音识别啊，太智障了。
- https://twitter.com/dingyi/status/1635915285369880576
- 汽车行业这块非常保守，加上有各种利益问题

- ## 记录了独立开发创始人成功的案例访谈，更新的也挺频繁，盈利全都是公开的。

- ## 一个api工具居然可以养活一个公司的程序员
- https://twitter.com/tualatrix/status/1624603717751427074
- Google这破公司居然靠一个输入框市值万亿美金！肯定是泡沫没跑了
- 别说一个api了，有很多公司靠一个word敏感字检查插件能养活整个公司十几个人。
- data monetization 。api 只是数据服务的形式，值钱的的是背后的 data 。
- 他不知道的是有过亿的用户正在使用，而这些都是目标用户。更有数十亿有需求的待开发用户，市场一片

- ## 看到很多开发者觉得 AI 时代充满机会，但我没那么乐观，AI 时代的门槛显然高多了。
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1622459115510575108
  - 我觉得这是那些相关方向博士生的机会，跟我们写UI、写业务或者 Infra的程序员关系不太大啊，至少肯定不是主导者……（我一直觉得掌握核心技术的才会是获益者，是不是太局限了？
- infra可以用它写脚本。又好又快。
  - 同样ui开发也可以用它生产代码。我不是做ui的你可以尝试一下。
- 自从大数据兴起后，各种技术浪潮其实和个体开发者关系不大吧
  - 之前刷到过一个推把AI也列为去中心技术，我看不懂但大受震撼。
- 数据不开放，怎么搞都没法跨过去的坎，天生是巨头的主场。
- 融资讲故事的机会更大
- 实际上可能是：一两家公司做出超一流的泛用型foundation model （类似于gpt3）以API形式提供 （商业逻辑和模型大小考量）. 剩下的公司和开发者，则针对细分领域来做优化. 更好的UIUX，对市场的洞察，更方便的特定数据导入等反而更重要.

- ## 现在很多初创公司直接用GPT-3的API，架个网站就上线了。
- https://twitter.com/bearbig/status/1621783925331988486
  - 但如果是国内，自己做网站光是走走备案登记的流程就会劝退一批人了。更何况基本都是用微信。
  - 生态环境完全不利于web。难怪很多独立开发者还是做app。至少操心的事情少一些。
- 国内还只能做 iOS 🥹... Android 市场有一堆合规需求。 Web 开发同样有很多限制，备案登记、支付接入等等等🤦‍♂️。各种算起来只能是在做 app 开发了。
- 架设 server 只给 app 提供 api，不提供网页浏览，需要备案吗？
  - 需要备案，我就备案了
  - 应该是需要备案的 比如如果走小程序 请求的https填写的必须是备过案的
  - ios的app不知道有没有这个要求，没有的话就可以不需要备案
  - 直接ip访问不用备案，需要备案的主要是域名。只要用域名，并且提供网络服务就要备案。
- app在国内市场上线也很难，软著之类的不能少。做国外市场限制会少点
- 现在在国内做Web2+Web3，合规资质要一堆，我深深地被搞死，到现在我们区块链备案都没下来6个月了，还有EDI，ISP，各种资质，这还要内部找人，还这尿性，真他妈服了。

- ## Instagram 的创始人的新项目 Artifact 简单说就是美国版的今日头条？
- https://twitter.com/oran_ge/status/1621303421189124096
- 恩，“文字版tiktok”居然用这种让美国人能理解的表达方式
  - 对 仔细想想美国这个市场确实空白
  - 也不是吧，还有沈向洋的Newsbreak呢

- ## 今天又发现一个神奇的网站，可以输入一个单词，自动找到包含这个词的YouTube视频，并自动定位到单词所在的进度条位置，同时展示字幕。
- https://twitter.com/oran_ge/status/1618469008256413697?s=20&t=4XYmgW_2XQaTgAR4xAeyyA
  - 还支持美音，英音，各种奇怪的其他口音…
  - 单词例句神器，这玩意儿还有 obsidian 插件，可以把平时收集的单词都放到 ob 然后快速地查例句

- ## 抖音上很多只有几十观看的小直播间都在用虚拟主播，脸部表情和口型捕捉都非常精准，不知道是哪家公司提供的技术？
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1590578620866899968
- 是滤镜，但就算是metahuman，也不难了，用苹果faceid做面部追踪，后期抠图替换头部也不难，可以参考codemiko，有详细技术介绍

- ## 前 15 年互联网创业潮，PHP 炙手可热，结果过十年就不热了；
- https://twitter.com/im2gua/status/1587969778160762881
  - 前 10 年移动互联网热，移动开发一将难求，引无数程序员竞扎堆，过了 10 年，移动开发没人要了；
  - 前 5 年 AI 热，带动一大票算法工作者，现在？陆续传出裁算法、ML/DL 人员了。
  - 所以说，技术含金量看形势，没有高明的技术，只有现实的需求。
- 只有crud是刚需…
- 是这么个道理，绝大部技术能力纯粹是为了需求服务的，只有需求出现暴涨的红利时，技术才会跟着吃到红利，新技术在没有新需求急需其来解决的时候，很难有啥特别的成长，就那样吧。
- 你自己列出来的这些趋势，不是很明朗地展现了计算机行业对人类世界的巨大影响么，从简单交互到移动交互，再到智能化，小马赌元宇宙的逻辑是一样的，实际上人类历史上没有任何一个行业能够同计算机给人类的改变相提并论，几千年才迭代出来的水稻栽培技术足够慢吧，你prefer这样的技术演化么。

- ## 跟着回忆了一下国内移动互联网的发展历程。令我感到惊讶的是移动互联网时代成长起来的巨头们，似乎没有一个是技术立家的。
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1531094977006403584
  - 在其叙事中还刻意突出了不专业的特性，倒也能让我重新思考价值和技术的关系。
  - 这本书强调的其实只有一个词：机遇。
  - 在时代面前产品和技术都显得那么不重要，是有点令人沮丧的。

- ## We are excited to announce the launch of Preset’s Managed Private Cloud (MPC)☁️🚀! Preset users now have the ability to deploy Preset workspaces inside their own #AWS #privatecloud as a fully managed solution.
- https://twitter.com/preset_data/status/1532029240757178368

- ## The very big news I mentioned yesterday: @modulz has been acquired by @WorkOS . 
- https://twitter.com/colmtuite/status/1532024536673271810
  - Myself, @sdothaney , and the team have joined to continue working on UI projects and OSS. 
  - It's been an incredible ride, here's a quick recap 👇
- It's been over 4 years since myself and @sdothaney founded Modulz. 
  - Ultimately, **we didn't manage to find PMF for Modulz, but we've accomplished a lot that I'm proud of**.
  - We built a super strong team who shipped some mind-blowing tech, and maintained a high bar for design quality.
  - Radix is one of the highest-quality UI component libs available. With 4M+ npm installs/month, it's being used in production by hundreds of awesome teams including Vercel, Supabase, CodeSandbox, Linear, and of course, WorkOS.
  - We also managed to make Stitches the fastest runtime CSS-in-JS lib available, with easy-to-use APIs offering a great DX.
- When @grinich first reached out, we chatted for an hour about Radix, helping companies solve time-consuming challenges around SSO and UI, and the importance of design quality. 
  - It was clear I was talking with someone who cares about these things as much as I do.
  - Lastly, @WorkOS just announced an $80M Series B alongside this acquisition 💰

- ## Why subscription-based revenue models work
- https://grid.is/@grid/subscription-revenue-models-the-basics-3BdnnNcBTF:DMCY84TKiCA
  - If you're familiar with software as a service (SaaS) business models – or Netflix for that matter – you're likely aware of how popular subscription-based revenue models have become.
  - Software as a service (SaaS) companies can be very successful with a subscription-based revenue model, especially within a product-led growth (PLG) approach

- ## http://Replay.io is a runtime company. 
- https://twitter.com/jasonlaster11/status/1494430547153674253
  - All runtimes (Browsers, Node, Python, ...) should be replayable.
  - We're improving our runtime tooling so that eventually anyone can make their own runtimes replayable as well.

- ## I can’t prove this but I suspect if someone built a Next.js/Remix/etc for React Native (i.e. single codebase for client and server) they would make a trillion dollars
- https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1489755769876754434
  - The ideal version of this would also do server rendering and hydration of native views. Something we hope to add to React one day. (There’s a stub for this in our repo, not implemented.)

- ## Monetizing OSS is difficult by nature, but I hope people will pay if they find a value. 
- https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1489205927542591488
  - It's more meaningful to pay for a content, instead of tipping for OSS. So, I decided to challenge. 
  - This is my first paid content to teach the library code, Zustand.

- ## WebVM
- https://webvm.io/
- https://github.com/leaningtech/webvm
  - WebVM is a server-less virtual Linux environment running fully client-side in HTML5/WebAssembly. 
  - In this demo, it runs an unmodified Debian distribution including many native development toolchains.
  - WebVM is powered by the CheerpX virtualization engine, and enables safe, sandboxed client-side execution of x86 binaries on any browser.
  - CheerpX includes an x86-to-WebAssembly JIT compiler, a virtual block-based file system, and a Linux syscall emulator.

- ## ar5iv
- https://ar5iv.org/
- Articles from arXiv.org as responsive HTML5 web pages.
  - Converted from TeX with LaTeXML.
  - Sources upto the end of 2021. Not a live preview service.
- https://twitter.com/khinsen/status/1488415031972843526
  - You can download / archive them, and convert them to EPub for better reading (via pagination) on an e-ink device. No offline reading though, because of @MathJax .
  - For long-term archiving, better stick to the PDF files from arXiv. That is the weak point of HTML-based scholarly publishing.
  - 
- https://github.com/brucemiller/LaTeXML
  - LaTeXML is a TeX & LaTeX to XML, HTML, MathML, ePub, JATS, ... converter.
  - 实现语言为perl

- ## So when does @GitHub copilot SEO officially start?
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1461706183799189509
  - Keywords are now code comments, 
  - search results are now code snippets, 
  - core web vitals is how often your snippets are used in high profile public codebases.

- Especially considering that code is a very viable part of a content mix (in dev marketing at least)

- ## Remotion Success Story!
- https://twitter.com/JNYBGR/status/1438444378482221062
  - With http://MakeStories.io you can use drag and drop to create Google Web Stories, and with the Remotion-powered rendering engine, export them as MP4 as well!

- ## Just added a Wall of Love powered by @testimonialto

- ## I know of like 9 companies trying to build their own internal in-house Vercel-like platform on AWS. 
- https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1386411683074101248
  - Huge opportunity for an ambitious open source project or consultancy.
- https://github.com/getmeli/meli
  - platform for deploying static sites and frontend applications.
- https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify
  - self-hostable Heroku & Netlify alternative
- Our(Vercel) answer to this is continuing to invest in advanced Enterprise features: "bring your own" CI, VPC peering, more resource isolation features on the horizon. 
  - We're thrilled so many govt, fintech, and healthcare customers are enjoying the @vercel platform already.
  - More broadly… building, maintaining, securing and operating your frontend & global edge infrastructure is hard, undifferentiated stuff.
  - The big question is whether folks *should* focus on this instead of investing in their app experiences.

- ## “汉典重光”项目
- https://twitter.com/yun_chuang/status/1400012043680423936
  - 据不完全估计，散落海外的中国古籍超过400万册。
  - 由阿里巴巴达摩院、四川大学、美国加州大学伯克利分校、中国国家图书馆、浙江图书馆合作的“汉典重光”项目，旨在寻觅流散海外的中国古籍并将其数字化、公共化，
  - 首批20万页古籍已发布，并研发了一套古籍AI识别系统，支持全文检索

- ##  I found Notion is the one-stop solution for all note-taking purposes 
- https://twitter.com/iamrohitgund/status/1325229159027630080
  - but only one problem I faced is that I can't copy tables to Microsoft Word or other platforms. 
  - If there is any way to do that I can shift 100% from Evernote, Microsoft To-do, etc
- Our(Notion's) tables are databases, not spreadsheets, so there's some fundamental differences compared to other programs.
  - That being said, you should be able to copy + paste into a spreadsheet. 
  - You can also export content as .csv!

- ## Time for the annual "What are people using to blog these days?" question. 
- https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/1389585490412818440
  - I think I want to just use plain HTML at this point. 
  - Or maybe something pre-made that generates HTML.
  - I definitely don't want to maintain yet another code base.
- Jekyll, for the last 5 years or so. Just a bunch of markdown files and a template.

- ## Turn your github issues into a CMS for your blog
- https://twitter.com/renatorib_/status/1387496644158033922
  - https://github.com/renatorib/github-blog
  - 依赖graphql，不依赖react
- Imagine doing a template repo based on this library.
  - It renders HTML using a vercel cloud function with given cache time or using github actions on a secondary branch.
  - You fork it, setup the PAT and HTML template, setup vercel to deploy the repo and start posting.
  - I'm doing it XD. It's actually a starter template using next
- I was thinking about a cloud function generated HTML with Cache-Control fetching comments asynchronously on load but NextJS can even fit better for this.
  - Basically what NextJS do almost out of the box with SSG XD

- ## JavaScript based projects ideas
1.  URL Shortener
2.  Whether App
3.  Todo App
4.  YouTube Web Player
5.  Stock Website
6.  Portfolio website
7.  Video conferencing app
8.  Web based terminal
9.  Browser code editor
- Pro Tip: Host these projects on AWS, and push the code to GitHub.

- ## I seriously love this Github comment feature
- https://twitter.com/LukyVJ/status/1385164657007149058

```suggestion
your suggestion here 
```

- I only wish it worked well with nested fenced code blocks (e.g., when suggesting to add a Markdown code example). I suspect it’s parsed with a lazy regular expression.
  - you can add an extra ` to the outer one. it's in the spec
  - https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-95
- This has 100% changed the way we do code reviews and it's amazing. If only GitHib could also lint/Prettier the suggestions before committing them though.

- ## The next frontier in product design tools is in making prototypes/designs/sketches that are NOT disposable - that are coupled with the platform they describe.
- https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1385153436954546177
  - In other words, imagine making a PR to your repo from Figma/Excalidraw.
- Imagine a design tool that could:
  - PR a failing test to your repo that passes when you complete the work it describes.
  - Create application flows driven by 'typed holes' that the developer fills in.

- ## Things web apps can do by default that I wish native apps could do, too:
- https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1383350431619837955
  - Zoom in anywhere
  - Copy any UI text
  - Clone the current view(open the current page in new tab)
  - Bookmark the current location
- May I add?
  - allow for script blocking (ads, tracking etc)
  - allow for loading custom stylesheets (reader mode, dark mode, accessibility - this requires a bit technical knowledge on HTML/CSS)
  - allow for being consumed on any device (even via terminal!)
- Android 11 can copy any text, but it's not really pretty.
  - Note: you must be in app switcher mode (app not maximized) to enable text selection.

- ## If you use Next.js, what is your favourite part about it?
- https://twitter.com/heybereket/status/1378889849235775489
- Speed, fast refresh, next/image, SSR, ISR!
- The examples folder on GitHub. Every important OS project should have sth like that

- ## I'm so glad I used MDX for my blog. 
- https://twitter.com/joshwcomeau/status/1243136771652751360
  - It enables things that otherwise would not be possible with Markdown or a CMS, while still being a consumable data source (unlike having the posts be all-JSX)
- I created an `<Asterisk>` component because I wanted to add XKCD-style "jokes on hover". 
  - Plus, I tend to be very verbose, and this means I can pack some of that away into an opt-in annotation.
  - For tangential information, I have a `Sidenote` component. It has a `title` prop which accepts JSX, so I can use any special formatting within it. Also a `type` which accepts info/warning/error/success.
  - For code snippets, I built a little playground component on top of react-live. You can pass props using the typical Markdown code-snippet syntax. 
  - Because animated GIFs tend to be huge, I use "video GIFs", similar to social media platforms. I created a component for this, and allowed it to support both `light` and `dark` variants, to swap out the src depending on the user's color theme.
  - The examples I'm showing are JSX-heavy, which might give you the wrong idea. For the most part, my blog posts look like any other Markdown doc.
- Because HTML is valid Markdown I like using Web Components to do the same thing. 

- ## cascading data updates
- https://twitter.com/chris_whong/status/1376626993614184452
  - Wouldn't it be rad if you could tell a dataset to check its source data every hour and create an updated version of itself if there are changes?

- ## A map quiz for this month's #ironquest - Game
- https://twitter.com/ShijiaWendy/status/1376465383813615620
  - [island shape quiz](https://public.tableau.com/views/IslandShapeQuiz/STARTDB?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link&:showVizHome=no)
- I had much fun playing with @Mapbox to make those patterns.

- ## Mermaid for Markdown is not only supported on GitHub but also in #VSCode it seems - code on left, preview on right 
- https://twitter.com/_s_hari/status/1376353291525881864
- Correction: Mermaid is supported on #AzureDevOps. 

- ## I would pay so so so much money for a Figma-based service in that:
- https://twitter.com/Allan/status/1375975277294055425
  - Adds something like tailwind and/or syncs tailwind.config.js as a Figma design system.
  - Exports frames as usable React components. Down to linking Figma symbols to JSON coming out of a fetch or axios.

- ## I just published an introduction to the @jsonstat toolkit as a notebook
- https://twitter.com/badosa/status/1375212974592421889
- This notebook shows you the main features of the jsonstat-toolkit using data from different official statistics providers like Eurostat, UNECE
  - https://observablehq.com/d/22fc6d7389380799
  - JSON-stat is a simple lightweight JSON dissemination(传播, 散布) format best suited for data visualization, mobile apps or open data initiatives, that has been designed for all kinds of disseminators.

- ## I'm really excited to announce Serenity Notes
- https://twitter.com/nikgraf/status/1374619720842944513
  - It's an end-to-end encrypted collaborative notes app allowing you to compose private & shared notes.
  - Think of a simple Google Docs, but end-to-end encrypted and offline-first.
  - and forgot to mention that the client/app code is open source
  - https://github.com/SerenityNotes/serenity-notes-clients
- Is it built on top of a decentralized protocol like  scuttlebutt.nz?
  - I initially started out building it on top of the Matrix Protocol, but hit some roadblocks and eventually went a level deeper directly building a custom protocol on top of gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm
  - It's still very much inspired by parts of the Matrix Protocol, but no federation atm
  - I would love to see it go decentralised by default and a backup to dropbox/drive by choice 
  - Encrypted backups to iCloud/GDrive are one of the next things on the roadmap
- pure CRDTs? how did you solve for undo/redo? checkpoints for docs with lots of changes?
  - I'm using https://github.com/yjs/yjs and this is the true magic behind the editor. 
- Desktop/web version is planning?
  - Yeah, started working on a Desktop (macOS) version and after that would focus on Windows.
  - Web would be great, but there are certain security implications and also the offline-first part is hard. So not planning to do this anytime soon.

- ## I'm super impressed by the approach @craftdocsapp is taking to data ownership. 
- https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1374144532976168967
  - 提出了制定markdown在线多人共同编辑协议的建议
  - At the same time, I think they're hitting the limits of modern data storage platforms, and hinting at precisely why we need a new kind of "collaborative filesystem".
- As context, Craft is an iOS/Mac notetaking app w/ a "blocks" model that feels inspired by Notion.
  - Unlike Notion it's offline-first (= very fast!). 
  - The interesting thing is they offer two different ways to store your data
- Option 1 is to sync your notes to Craft's servers.
  - The benefit of this is you get realtime collaboration, and you can share a web link with anyone to get comments. 
  - Feels similar to GDocs/Notion, just with much better offline mode.
- Option 2 is to store data on your filesystem. 
  - The benefit here is data ownership: more privacy, and you can open the files in other apps without issue.
- Now, if you want sync with Option 2, you can bring your own w/ iCloud Drive etc. But if two devices edit concurrently, you'll hit conflicts.
  - They currently store data in a JSON format but are trying to move to Markdown as a canonical storage format. Would make the "data ownership" even more meaningful since you could just edit their files w/ any Markdown editor!
- So, to review -- user gets to choose either Option 1 or 2 for any note. Which is already amazing and beyond most other apps!
  - But... it's also annoying that I have to choose. Could we have an Option 3 where we get the best of both worlds?
  - Concretely, what I want is something like a "filesystem", where I own the data and can open it in whatever app I choose.
  - But I don't want manual conflict merging every time two people simultaneously edit a doc. The "filesystem" needs to know how to merge changes.
- In other words: why does Craft (and Figma and GDocs and Notion and Pitch...) have to implement their own custom realtime sync protocol?
  - Could we just have a user-owned "filesystem" that deals w/ that part? So I can open a file in multiple apps, and have them sync in realtime?
- **The world I'm imagining** is one where I have Craft open, and you have Notion open, and another collaborator has VSCode open and we're all editing the same document live, perhaps from slightly different perspectives.
  - Curious if people think this "new collaborative filesystem" would be valuable and what the biggest challenges are.
  - To me, feels like the biggest tension is standardizing vs. diverging "file formats", and seeing how much common ground can be found between apps.
- Some intriguing projects which are taking on aspects of this challenge:
  - Braid (braid.org), a generic protocol for state sync
  - Fission (fission.codes), platform for building apps where users own the data
- The original local-first article from I&S is always worth a re-read for thinking about this tradeoff space.
  - But I think the extra tricky part is going beyond "individual devs should do local-first" to "we should have a cross-app local-first FS"
- I believe that future is possible with event sourcing. @todoist somewhat done this with their sync API.
- As long as we have:
  - websocket/web etc
  - ordered list of events 
  - SDK that convert events to data

- ## What are y’all using for for team collaboration on documents, product specs, etc beside Notion? I’m looking for something faster and less clunky than Notion.
- https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1373788153207734275
- Notion has made me appreciate Google Docs. Next up Dropbox Paper.
- Confluence, but it's definitely not faster or less clunky than Notion 

- ## prototyping a tool for messing with data
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1362609484519014400
  - https://github.com/paulshen?tab=repositories&type=source
  - non-live panes (eg side effects like network requests)
  - promise values
  - pop-out expression
  - I'm trying an experiment where all the code lives in one file. see how long til i break
  - main inspiration was an interactive curl | jq
- I think there's also interesting territory to explore around not directly coding the transformation, but instead just demonstrating it "directly on the data"...
- https://github.com/stedolan/jq
  - Command-line JSON processor 
- One dream GUI builder I imagine is like:
  - Reshape from API response into the JSON underlying your UI, in something like your demo tool
  - Style the data into an actual UI in something like this:
- I've been jamming on this concept for making data-driven designs. 
  - Given some JSON, this app will provide you with an interface to describe how you want each entry styled, allowing you to gradually create a more complicated design. Here I create an airbnb-ish app.
  - So the controls make it look a lot like other "no-code" solutions like @webflow , but I think the data-first approach makes it a pretty different experience, perhaps more suitable for apps than for say landing pages.

- ## What are people using for versioned controlled diagrams/flow charts/ etc these days?  Is graphviz/plantuml still the goto?
- https://twitter.com/mat4nier/status/1369769536816226306
- I’ve gotten _really_ good at Graphviz. There’s a PlantUML plugin for Confluence, btw
- plantuml and mermaid mostly

- ## best software to create sequence diagrams like this?
- https://twitter.com/sseraphini/status/1369996346493652995
- I use plantuml for my docs diagrams. 
  - Not the slickest or most modern-looking results, but does the job well and the diagrams are text files that can be put under source control which is nice.
- Write them using mermaid syntax for better version control
- Visual Paradigm.

- ## I'm happy to announce, that basetools.io is in beta! 
- https://twitter.com/sebastianhoitz/status/1369390750404927490
  - It is a paywall for your Github repository or npm package. 
  - Just connect to GitHub, set a price, and charge for access to your repository.
- You can think of it as Gumroad but specifically targeting developers selling their UI components, frameworks, starter templates, or libraries.
  - I think there are huge opportunities for developers to sell their projects and earn a living this way. Lots of exciting projects getting started, too. 
  - People like @adamwathan or @mxstbr are leading the way. I'm sure there is going to be plenty more.
  - I want to support developers with basetools.io by basically taking care of a lot of the barriers to this: Charging money, making sure it has the correct taxes, writing invoices, granting access only to people that paid - This is what we do.
- This could go really well or really, really bad. 
  - Hopefully it doesn't turn into a situation like the Unity Asset Store where folks reskin libraries simply looking to profit. 
  - There could be an explosion of low quality libraries that only serve to add confusion.
- What's the difference between this and GumHub by @m1guelpf ?
  - Sell access to your GitHub repos with Gumroad

- ## 考察了一下EFC这边写字楼（美国中心）的价格。小办公室大约60平（建筑面积，实际40平），每平3块多
- https://twitter.com/tualatrix/status/1694237227793191246
  - 家里的鱼太多了
- 还是缺少仪式感
- 物业费也是很大的一块支出
  - 写字楼物业费挺贵的，这块估计得到 10 块钱一平一月。水费公摊，相比房租少两个数量级。电会贵一点。宽带在写字楼只能拉企业宽带，电信的话慧企通最低 299 每月，200M 下行 30M 上行
- 40 其实还算上公摊的，实际上能够坐的工位也就4-6个，非常的不实用（还有顺便提一句，EFC 的停车费也和‘欧美’挂钩的，比上海都贵…

- 从我这些年经历过写字楼，wework单间，独立公寓的小团队办公室经验来看。如果你附近公寓租金便宜，优先推荐租个居民公寓，腾空自己适当布置，感受和性价比会远高于前两者
- 一开始还是用联合办公空间比较合适，或者租民房办公
  - 民房同样的面积往往比写字楼便宜一倍，反正不是要对外迎客的话，都差不多。不过民房不能做工商注册。

- efc没必要啦 余杭那么多便宜的地方
- 可以看看附近的杭师大科技园的，或者再向西看看人工智能小镇的，大概可以便宜1/3。
