  - Most tutorials tell you to use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)`. That's fine for demos, but in production, it breaks
    - PDF tables get shredded into nonsense.
    - Code blocks get cut in half.
    - Markdown headers lose their hierarchy.
  - I stripped out all the business logic from my app and left just the "Smart Loader".
  - It uses Docling (by IBM) for layout-aware parsing and applies heuristics to choose the optimal chunk size based on file type.
    - PDFs: Uses semantic splitting with larger chunks (800 chars) to preserve context.
    - Code: Uses small chunks (256 chars) to keep functions intact.
    - Markdown: Respects headers and structure.
    - Output: Clean Markdown that your LLM actually understands.

# ocr/vlm
- https://github.com/emcf/thepipe /1.5kStar/MIT/202510/python/inactive
  - a package that can scrape clean markdown, multimodal media, and structured data from complex documents.
  - It can extract well-formatted data from a wide range of sources, including PDFs, URLs, Word docs, Powerpoints, Python notebooks, videos, audio, and more.
  - Uses VLM for OCR in text-only mode
  - Accepts a wide range of sources, including PDFs, URLs, Word docs, Powerpoints, Python notebooks, GitHub repos, videos, audio, and more
  - The default install only pulls in CPU-friendly dependencies so it is suitable for constrained environments and CI systems. 
    - GPU-enabled libraries such as PyTorch and Triton are left as optional extras.
  - 👾 By default, thepipe uses the OpenAI API, so VLM features will work out-of-the-box provided you pass in an OpenAI client.
    - If you wish to use a local vision-language model or a different cloud provider, you can provide a custom OpenAI client
  - structured extraction is being deprecated and will be removed in future releases. The current implementation is a simple wrapper around OpenAI's chat API, which is not ideal for structured data extraction. We recommend OpenAI's structured outputs for structured data extraction, or using Trellis AI for automated workflows with structured data.

    - I'm developing a RAG system for enterprise (B2B) and noticed that many company documents contain charts, images, and other non-text elements. Our current parsers (Docling, Unstructured) struggle to process these formats. While searching for a solution, I couldn't find any parser leveraging modern VLMs—so I decided to build one myself.
    - Currently, Reader VL processes entire documents in a single pass. I'm actively working on implementing chunking and batching functionalities to better support very large documents, such as those spanning hundreds or thousands of pages.

# extraction
- https://github.com/datalab-to/pdftext /644Star/apache2/202506/python
  - Text extraction like `PyMuPDF`, but without the AGPL license. PDFText extracts plain text or structured blocks and lines. 
  - It's built on `pypdfium2`, so it's fast, accurate, and Apache licensed.
  - It first uses pypdfium2 to extract characters in order, along with font and other information. Then it uses a simple decision tree algorithm to group characters into lines and blocks. It does some simple postprocessing to clean up the text.
  - built on some amazing open source work, including:  pypdfium2, scikit-learn

  - Uses a large language model (LLM) to transform unstructured or semi-structured text into structured data—validated by Pydantic models or JSON Schema—via an OpenAI-compatible API.
  - OCR tools: Tesseract (for OCRmyPDF), a GPU for faster OCR (Marker and PaddleOCR)
  - OpenAI-compatible API endpoint: Required for information extraction

    - Models tested : Qwen2, MiniCPM, Bunny, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 flash,  Claude 3.5
    - I have chosen these models because they fit on a consumer GPU (less than 24GB VRAM)
  - Datasets used: SROIE and CORD receipt datasets - i’ve explained why these in the blog, but tldr is that they are 
    - standardized (and hence simpler to benchmark)
    - complex enough to present a challenge to all the VLMs
    - no MLLM benchmarks focussing on extracting structured data from documents
    - Both fields and tables are present in the datasets
  - Takeaways
    - QWEN is the superior OS model, and Claude is the best among closed source
