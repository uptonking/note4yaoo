- ## [Code formatting in code mirror - discuss. CodeMirror _202107](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/code-formatting-in-code-mirror/3405)
- I tried several optionsÔºö
  - Implemented through LSP, just call the `textDocument/formatting` event Specification
  - In the node middle tier, prettier and some additional packages (eg sql-format‚Ä¶) are called for code formatting. ÔºàExecuting autopep8 in node to achieve python code formatting is also an ideaÔºâ
  - Use prettier‚Äôs browser, unfortunately this doesn‚Äôt support all features very well

- ## [Is there a refactoring extension? - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror _202410](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/is-there-a-refactoring-extension/8700)
- A linting extension exists, but not queried via language data (because linting tends to be a whole-document thing starting at the top, rather than contextual). 
  - Lint diagnostics may include a ‚Äòactions‚Äô, which are simply functions called for its side effect, that can be used for refactoring hints. There‚Äôs no built-in support for refactoring beyond that.

- ## [Start on supporting autoimports ¬∑ Pull Request ¬∑ val-town/codemirror-ts _202412](https://github.com/val-town/codemirror-ts/pull/46)
  - Start supporting go-to-definition with workers. right now punting(Áî®ÊñπÂ§¥ÊàñÂπ≥Â∫ïËàπÊãñËøê) on a non-worker implementation. 

- ## [ctrl + click to jump - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror _202312](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/ctrl-click-to-jump/7613)
- CodeMirror doesn‚Äôt know enough about your code to tell you where a given identifier is defined. If you do have that information, for example by integrating a language server, cursor jumping shouldn‚Äôt be hard to implement.

```JS
view.dispatch({
  selection: { anchor: targetPosition },
  scrollIntoView: true
})
```

- Use `EditorView.domEventHandlers` to bind an event handler, then `posAtCoords` to find the position at those coordinates, and, probably,  `syntaxTree` and `resolveInner` to figure out what the user clicked on.

- ## [TypeScript integration ¬∑ codesandbox/sandpack _202112](https://github.com/codesandbox/sandpack/discussions/237)
- Vocs is solving this elegantly with Twoslash

- ## ‚úèÔ∏èüÜöÔ∏è [Codemirror 6 and Typescript LSP - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror _202107](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/codemirror-6-and-typescript-lsp/3398)
  - If anyone is still having problems with this, I was able to create a small demo based on @madebysid comment, you can find it here: https://github.com/okikio/codemirror 197, Demo Link: https://okikio-codemirror.netlify.app/

- For the @codesanbox/sandpack-react package there was a discussion on how to integrate the language server with codemirror.
- I‚Äôd like to share the progress I made on integrating the TypeScript LSP into Sandpack, which uses CodeMirror in the editor component. Fortunately, I could implement most of the features I had planned thanks to the amazing examples from @okikio and @madebysid.
- Here‚Äôs the full list of feature:
  IntelliSense; 
  Tooltip error; 
  Multiple files; 
  Support tsconfig.json; 
  Automatically dependency-types fetching (CodeSandbox CDN); 
  In-browser dependency cache; 
- TBH, I‚Äôm not an expert on CodeMirror even less on LSP, so I‚Äôm curious to know how I can improve this implementation and make it even better
  - https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/danilowoz/sandpack-tsserver/tree/main/

- Did https://codesandbox.io/ switch away from CodeMirror to Monaco for it‚Äôs TypeScript/LSP editor? If so, is there a discussion somewhere of why? _202212
  - üí° Actually, CodeSandbox has always used Monaco as the default editor, except for a specific mobile version where we defaulted it to CodeMirror.
- Not to be pedantic, but it‚Äôs worth noting that tsserver / the typescript standalone worker is not LSP compatible.
  - Replit is working on open sourcing our LSP Client (we didn‚Äôt the microsoft packages) and a follow up to open source the LSP client + codemirror extension. Timeline TBD but should happen in 2023

- We were able to leverage much of the learning discussed here to implement Typescript completions for our open source multiplayer code editor VZCode
- It‚Äôs a more bit complex than the examples here because:
  - The system supports editing multiple files
  - The system supports remote collaborators (so their changes need to be accounted on the LSP side for in addition to local changes)
  - There are multiple instances of the CodeMirror extension that talk to a singleton language server
  - The singleton language server lives in a Web worker
