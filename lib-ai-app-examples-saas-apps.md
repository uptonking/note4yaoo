- https://github.com/Flame-Code-VLM/Flame-Code-VLM /apache2/202502/python
  - Flame: 一个基于数据合成提升多模态大模型前端开发能力的解决方案
  - 为提升多模态模型在生成依赖特定前端框架代码方面的能力，我们提出了一套解决方案，包含数据合成管线、模型训练及评估套件。基于该方案，我们构建了Flame模型，可根据图文信息生成特定框架的前端代码。
  - [数据合成] 最关键的挑战在于构建高质量的图-文（代码）数据。我们提出的智能体工作流驱动的数据合成管线能够提取、渲染并注释自包含的前端代码片段。该管线确保了生成的大规模、多样化且高保真的数据集，支持单图像和多图像输入，并提供详细的图像描述（可用于视觉思维推理开发）。
    - 我们的数据合成方法包括三种策略：基于进化思想的合成、基于瀑布流模型的合成以及基于增量式开发思想的合成，过程中通过DeepSeek API接入DeepSeek V2和V3模型进行数据构建，生成的图文（代码）数据将全部开源。
  - [模型训练] 我们通过两层MLP将Siglip图像编码器与Deepseek的代码模型连接，构建Flame模型，并采用三阶段训练策略。第一阶段预热两层连接器（使用公开的图文数据）；第二阶段训练图像编码器及连接器（使用我们合成的数据）；第三阶段进行SFT，训练所有参数（同样使用合成数据）。我们发现，在针对特定场景的数据下，这种训练方案表现出更好的效果。
  - [评估套件] 为确保生成代码符合实际开发标准，我们构建了一个全面的评估套件，评估生成代码的三个关键因素：语法精确性、功能正确性和视觉一致性。该评估方法将为未来的多模态模型代码生成能力提供可靠的测评标准。
  - 目前，该框架针对基于React的开发进行了设计和优化。该方法和管道具有高度可扩展性，只需进行少量修改即可适应其他前端框架，如Vue和Angular。
  - 注：Flame只关注React代码生成，非通用VLM。

## ai-gen-ui

- https://github.com/itzcrazykns/epoch /MIT/202511/ts
  - Epoch transforms traditional text-based AI conversations into interactive, component-driven experiences. 
  - Every response is rendered as a living interface with clickable elements, dynamic forms, live data visualizations, and explorable UI
  - Epoch eliminates llm text constraint through a structured component architecture. The LLM generates type-safe JSON schemas representing UI component trees, which are recursively rendered into fully interactive React interfaces.
  - 此方案和主流框架兼容性不好，memory/rag的pipeline都要定制处理
    - 但用来实现固定布局layout的card/bg等局部组件很方便
  - 依赖 aisdk, shadcn/ui + Radix UI, recharts
  - This architecture transforms LLMs from text generators into interface compilers, where every response is a composable tree of interactive components rather than static markup.
  - It's bidirectional. You can click a button or submit a form -> that interaction gets serialized back into conversation history -> LLM generates new UI in response.
  - streaming: Server-Sent Events stream partial object updates as the LLM generates component trees, with progressive rendering on the client
  - UIRenderer recursively traverses component trees, maintaining form state and action handlers through the entire tree depth
  - Local LLM Support: Run completely offline with Ollama integration
  - [Epoch: LLMs that generate interactive UI instead of text walls : r/LocalLLaMA _202511](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1oqc01w/epoch_llms_that_generate_interactive_ui_instead/)
  - Structured output schema doesn't take context, but I also included it in the system prompt for better performance with smaller Ollama models (system prompt is a bit bigger now, finding a workaround later)
  - Interesting, but the LLM can already spit it HTML if you instruct it. what is the failure rate on these? I presume you append all info in the system prompt to assure the LLM doesn't write poorly formatted interface, but it could easily output straight up wrong commands? Would it just error out? 
    - LLMs can spit out HTML but you cannot be sure of the consistency, styling, layout and everything but in my approach I used grammar (to force the model in generating in the format I want) which significantly reduces the error rate and can perform quite well without taking up much context (I can remove the entire examples from the system prompt and it'd still work on larger models since they have better attention distribution).
    - The error rate is very low, in my testing models less than 4B-6B params gave a few errors (that too bad UI not a failure), larger models and cloud models never really generated a bad UI. 
  - HTML itself is a structured declarative syntax. If you think about what the training corpus for a particular model looks like, it has seen WAY more HTML than a custom structured grammar. Don't overengineer for the sake of it. See if you can accomplish the same thing with simpler methods.
  - Can this support standard OpenAI Compatible API?
    - If your inference provider fully supports the OpenAI format and `grammar enforced decoding` then it can be used.
  - i tried more or less the same, but in some cases output generated would have valid schema, but maybe contain null values, which kind of defeats the whole purpose
  - Where does it take images?
    - The images are fetched via the serp API. I plan to add SearxNG support.
  - Arent ag-ui frameworks like copilotkit exactly for this?
    - Copilotkit renders predefined components in predefined style via function calling. I gave it the ability to generate how it wants the user to see its responses and it is done via grammar enforced decoding (structured outputs). 
    - In copilotkit, you might see the same structure again but with my approach you cannot say

    - Today we are launching @openwork_ai , an open-source (MIT-licensed) computer-use agent that’s fast, cheap, and more secure.
    - the result of a short two-day hackathon our team decided to hack, which brings together some of our favorite open source AI modules into one powerful agent
    - does it use @opencode in some way?
      - It certainly does! opencode is the agent harness here, sort of like Claude Code CLI is at Anthropic's Cowork app
    - any plan on sandbox or isolation?
      - Yes, coming up in the next couple of days.
    - Is it computer-use or browser-use?!
      - Both. It has file system access and can manipulate your computer. For browsing tasks it has a browser tool. Both are operated by the same agent

    - it’s basically an alternative gui for opencode, which (at least until now) has been more focused on technical folks.
    - the goal with openwork is to bring the kind of workflows i’m used to running in the cli into a gui, while keeping a very deep extensibility mindset. ideally this grows into something closer to an obsidian-style ecosystem, but for agentic work.
    - open by design: no black boxes, no hosted lock-in.
    - extensible: skills are installable modules via a skill/package manager, using the native opencode plugin ecosystem.
    - non-technical by default: plans, progress, permissions, and artifacts are surfaced in the ui, not buried in logs.

    - I don't understand the point when opencode desktop already exists.
    - it's fully integrated with Claude Skills.
    - What's the security boundary here - there's no mention of a VM or anything to isolate the agent from the file system?

  - https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs /MIT/202601/ts
    - Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is the simplest form of an agent. This architecture, however, can yield agents that are "shallow" and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks.
    - Applications like "Deep Research", "Manus", and "Claude Code" have gotten around this limitation by implementing a combination of four things: a planning tool, sub agents, access to a file system, and a detailed prompt.

  - TL; DR - We've released Craft Agents as an open source product - it showcases our take on how to effectively work with agents (Especially Claude Code). 
  - It enables intuitive multitasking, no-fluff connection to any API or Service, sharing sessions, and a more document (vs code) centric workflow - in a beautiful and fluid UI.
  - It leans on Claude Code through the Claude Agent SDK - follow what we found great, and improves areas where we've desired improvements.
  - We ourselves are building Craft Agents with Craft Agents only - no code editors - so really, any customisation is just a prompt away.
  - We built Craft Agents because we wanted a better, more opinionated (and preferably non-CLI way) of working with the most powerful agents in the world.

    - At the core is CAMEL’s Workforce system, which is inspired by distributing systems: a root node for task planning and coordination, worker nodes for execution, and an asynchronous task channel. It also supports failure tolerance and recursive workers for long-horizon tasks. All of this is open source.
    - the hardest problems we face today is the local desktop runtime. Supporting multiple operating systems, versions, and package mirrors has been extremely painful. Our desktop agent installs Python and TypeScript dependencies on first launch, and supporting this reliably across macOS and Windows has been more complex than we initially expected.
    - After looking into a VM-based approach that uses Apple’s Virtualization framework to run Ubuntu on macOS, we started wondering whether a similar setup could help.
    - I had to resolve the same issue, to run agent code cross platforms as is, I shipped a runtime which is basically eval inside restricted sandbox https://github.com/netdur/hugind
    - Nice work on the agent! The VM approach might help with the cross-platform headaches but could introduce its own complexity around hardware access and performance overhead
    - Have you considered containerizing just the Python/TS runtime while keeping native OS hooks for system calls?

    - Every line of code and comment serves as a prompt for agents. Code should be written clearly and readably, ensuring both humans and agents can interpret it effectively.
