- ## [Line background color and selection layering - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror _202212](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/line-background-color-and-selection-layering/5413)
  - In v5, you could select a line or wrap element to apply a class to a full line. By choosing the wrap class, you could style the containing element of some lines and apply, e.g., a background color to it. Then, if you selected something, you could first see the lineâ€™s background color, then the selection, and finally the text.
  - With the more lean DOM that v6 produces, there is no more wrapping, and hence the background color must be applied directly to the text layer.

- Have to use transparent backgrounds, or use the layer feature to display a separate element behind the selection layer.
