- The thing is that everybody will have to define their data model and validations somewhere somehow. 
  - So while everything in Feathers used to look super simple at the first glance, you end up getting that complexity somewhere else (how to convert the query, do validation, define and populate associations or get shared types were always big topics that didn't really have a good answer).
