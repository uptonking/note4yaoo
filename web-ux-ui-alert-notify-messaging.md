- Callouts are text excerpts, used as a visual cue to draw attention to the text.
- Callouts can contain an icon, a title and a message. 
- Use callouts to:
1. Warn users before asking them to take action. This is usually done in anticipation of a significant change.
2. Let users know something has gone wrong after they’ve tried to do something — as an error message.
3. Let users know they have successfully completed an action — as a success message.
4. Alert users about additional information without requiring an action — as an informative message.
