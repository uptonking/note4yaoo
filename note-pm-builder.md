## product-blocks

- blocks /MIT/3.5kStar/202006
  - https://github.com/blocks/blocks
  - https://blocks-ui.com/
  - A JSX-based page builder for creating beautiful websites without writing code
- How it works
  - Blocks is a parser, transformer, and renderer/compiler.
  - It's unique because it reads in valid, production-ready JSX code and treats the AST as its data structure. 
  - Information is queried from the AST and then changes to the canvas transform the AST.
  - It uses Babel and its plugin API for parsing and transforming. 
  - Events that happen in the canvas are emitted and run corresponding plugins on the source code.
