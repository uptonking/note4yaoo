- > code interpreter is not available yet. What do you plan to add ? Maybe code interpreter would only be available through official openai agents, which means that we would need to opt for an open source equivalent, like open interpreter ?
  - 👷202410: Unfortunately, this is not a simple problem. I'm happy to say after months of work, I've built something that will be highly compatible with LibreChat, to run code in a safe and secure manner, running many different languages (not just python or javascript), with the ability to work with and generate files, and scalable to many users. 
  - On open interpreter: it would be one of the least secure ways of doing this, and it's not scalable. It's mainly meant for a single-user environment.
- I would like to comment here for the first time that Code Interpreter functionality won't be open source. 
  - with this particular feature, I would like to protect the source code as it came from months of research, frustration, and trial and error, to build something truly effective and seamless across many use cases and principally for the use case of LibreChat Agents. I believe this would also give LibreChat a "competitive" edge 
  - My decision was also due to the fact that packaging this solution would significantly bloat the current tech stack, and with less compatibility across systems, thereby creating more maintenance overhead, not to mention the increased bandwidth.

- ## [GPT4 Code Interpreter in LibreChat with GPT4 and other versions of GPT · danny-avila/LibreChat _202308](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/796)
- my plan as of now is to use dominic's project, "codeinterpreter-api": https://github.com/shroominic/codeinterpreter-api
  - Rather than reinvent the wheel, and it's the best solution I've used.

- You can try this simple plug-in I made : https://github.com/ronith256/Code-Interpreter-LibreChat
  - It is very much in beta, and does not sandbox the python env.

- ## [Open-interpreter integration? · Issue · danny-avila/LibreChat _202310](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/1010)
- Open Interpreter (as in using the actual open interpreter library) could be easy but not scalable. A more scalable solution is harder to implement

- As a tool call maybe?

- ## [Connecting LibreChat to a local LM Studio, which hosts a Mistral 7B. _202402](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/1836)
- 🌰 This is what I used in my librechat.yaml for Mistral in LMStudio
  - Note: in LMStudio you need to enable the "server mode" since it's disabled by default
  - removed "user_provided" and replaced it with a dummy key
