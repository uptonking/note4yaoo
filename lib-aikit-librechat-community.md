- ## [Connecting LibreChat to a local LM Studio, which hosts a Mistral 7B. _202402](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/1836)
- ðŸŒ° This is what I used in my librechat.yaml for Mistral in LMStudio
  - Note: in LMStudio you need to enable the "server mode" since it's disabled by default
  - removed "user_provided" and replaced it with a dummy key
