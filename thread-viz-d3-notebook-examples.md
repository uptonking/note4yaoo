- ## I updated my @observablehq example of how to combine @d3js_org and @Mapbox to make it more reusable, using the D3 examples format.
- https://observablehq.com/@john-guerra/mapbox-d3
  - Just give it some topoJSON features and it will draw them with D3, letting Mapbox do the zoom and panning

- ## The new hexbin transform aggregates 2D points into hexagonal bins (true hexagons in screen space)

- ## Using scale to animate images between different aspect ratios will distort(‰ΩøÂèòÂΩ¢„ÄÅÊâ≠Êõ≤) them.

  - My advice is usually to use two elements, an image and an outer div to clip it. 
  - Here's a new approach that uses one element, applying scale correction to backgroundSize
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-scale-correction-for-transformed-images-ude0np?file=/src/App.js
- The downside to the background-size approach is you lose `<img>` semantics. 
- Here's a hacky version using the upcoming `object-view-box ` rule, which is viewBox for images.

- How are you handling layout changes if you're using transforms.
  - The CSS changes the layout (in this case width/height/margin) and the transforms animate the change
  - So what the point if using transforms if you still animate height and margin, etc...
  - You don't - you change width/height once, this changes the layout (the expensive operation). Then you undo the change using a transform, which you then animate back down to zero.
  - Here's a good write up of the general approach
