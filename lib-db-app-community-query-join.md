- ## Prisma doesnâ€™t JOIN (related records are fetched as separate requests from the DB) so I think itâ€™d be slow at the edge anyways_202310

- Hey Jake! While you are correct, we don't use Joins in every instance. We are currently doing a lot of work to fix this. We pushed out the initial change in 5.4. More to come! Thanks for using Prisma!

- With that said, the JOIN is a very powerful concept which, unfortunately, has been given a terrible reputation by the NoSQL community. Moving such logic out of the database and into to DB's client is just a waste of IO and computing bandwidth.
  - SQL has been the ONLY technology/language that has stuck with me for > 25 years. The fact that it is (apparently) not being taught by institutions of higher learning is just a shame.
- I agree. It took me 3 years or so to actually land in a project and learn SQL for the first time. Before it was all with ORMs. I didn't know what a join was for the first couple of years of my career. Understanding SQL and being able to work with data interactively has made me a better software engineer. This tech is important enough that it should be taught in university/coding camps.

- I often wonder how often this exact problem happens, but where A and B are [micro]services owned by two different teams, one is required by company policy to use their APIs not their raw databases, and escalation of each of these issues e.g. query size/rate limiting runs the risk of burning political capital on top of everything else.
