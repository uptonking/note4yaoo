  - A bit like Solr, but much smaller and not as bright.
  - For web applications with all their data already sitting in the client, it makes sense to be able to search that data on the client too. 
  - It saves adding extra, compacted services on the server. 
  - A local search index will be quicker, there is no network overhead, and will remain available and usable even without a network connection.
