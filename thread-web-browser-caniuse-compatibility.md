- ## üö® TIL: In Safari `navigator‚Å†.storage.persist` only works for "home screen apps".
- https://twitter.com/schickling/status/1753417758518173947
  - This means even with this API, every page you didn't visit for more than 7 day loses all of your data (localstorage, IDB, OPFS, ...)

- Here's a webkit bugzilla issue making a case for changing this behavior, with folks from 1Password and Simplenote chiming in. Unfortunately, the answer appears to be: save to home screen

- Are Chrome and Firefox any better?
  - Yes, works both in Chrome and Firefox.

- better to persist and sync localStorage with one of the https://0data.app protocols, @remotestorage_ even lets you connect dropbox and google drive

- ## JSPI, which lets you use async JS APIs from sync WebAssembly without asyncifying the entire app, is going to origin trial in Chrome 123
- https://twitter.com/v8js/status/1768755661083701361

- ##  `ElementInternals.states` is coming in Safari 17.4, which means only Firefox is left ‚Äî and it's already available behind a flag.
- https://twitter.com/claviska/status/1765707964692697564

- ## üåä `ReadableStream` async iteration is coming to a Chromium-based browser near you! 
- https://twitter.com/MattiasBuelens/status/1765655738095960191
  - In Chrome Canary, this now works: `for await (const chunk of response.body) {}`

- Also tastes great combined with WebSocketStream
  - `for await (const message of wss.readable) {}`

  - [Dialogs and popovers seem similar. How are they different? _202309](https://hidde.blog/dialog-modal-popover-differences/)

- `popover` is available:
  - Chrome (116) and Edge (115)
  - Safari 17
  - Firefox from 114 (behind dom.element.popover.enabled flag)

- ## With Edge 121 supporting AVIF, it will soon cross the 90% adoption mark

- ## Perhaps one of the most pleasant surprises of 2023 was Safari going all-in on PWA. 
- https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1736081020393521620
  - Add To Dock in macOS Sonoma and full support for web push notifications has made it a joy to use and develop PWAs. 
  - Native still has a place, of course, but it's a smaller one than it was.

- iOS and iPadOS 16.4 beta 1 is now available with:
  ‚Ä¢ Web Push for Home Screen web apps 
  ‚Ä¢ Focus support for Web Push
  ‚Ä¢ Third-party browser support for Add to Home Screen
  ‚Ä¢ Badging API 
  ‚Ä¢ Manifest ID 

- ## You can reduce the number of DOM elements and DOM operations _by a lot_ and speed things up as a result by highlighting things with the CSS Custom Highlight API
- https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1653421306128334848
  - Sadly isn't supported in Firefox and Safari
- So are all of your debugging tools highlights?
  - No the thing that draws rectangles around elements does that on a transparent canvas, you can't implement something like that with highlights. There's only a limited set of CSS properties that they support (to stay super fast).
- Did anybody mention a text editor that uses this API?
  - There may be some problems in practice, like for example I think you can't make text bold just with highlights, and you may need some wrapping anyway to make like links clickable.
- TIL about the Custom Highlight API. Looks pretty useful to mark search results and that sort of thing. Great find!

- ## It is now 2023 and `display: contents` still breaks accessibility in Safari.
- https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1628501529207402497
- Display contents was a complete mess. It doesn‚Äôt work right in any browser. Try using it in a contenteditable for comical effect.

- While Google Chrome used WebKit for macOS client at one point, that's no longer the case for current stable build.
  - WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine; 
  - **all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink**
- The restriction to use WebKit as the rendering engine for 3rd party Web browser apps exists solely on iOS. 

- ## Just confirmed: iOS 15 now supports the HTML5 drag and drop API on iPhone!

- ## macOS Big Sur started hiding scrollbars. Here's why I think it's bad and what we can do about it.
- https://twitter.com/dluzar/status/1428758952389533700
  - Apple introduced automatic scrollbar hiding which is enabled by default when no mouse peripheral is connected. 
  - This not only applies to the system scrollbars, but to websites as well.
- Scrollbars serve two purposes. 
  - One is obviously to allow you to scroll content. 
  - The other is to indicate whether there is more content to be scrolled to.
  - Apple decided that since you can use a trackpad there's no need for scrollbars, completely ignoring the second aspect.
- The best thing about it is, the Mac OS scrollbar autohiding doesn't apply to custom scrollbars. It's unclear how long this will remain the case.
  - You can style it as you want, but there are couple of downsides.
  - First, you can't replicate the browser look because the scrollbar arrows are hidden when using these CSS rules.
  - Second, it doesn't work in Firefox (they instead implement `scrollbar-color` and `scrollbar-width` that in turn no one else does ‚Äî and it doesn't fix the autohiding).
- Since most devs use macOS, they may not even be aware that their sites could have potentially broken layout on Windows where scrollbars are visible by default.
- Another problem is unnecessary layout changes when the scrollbar shows. 
  - Luckily `scrollbar-gutter` is on the horizon

- ## We're experimenting with a page transition API in Chrome. 
- https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1427656326172262400
  - It's just for SPAs right now, but you can use it on real sites via an origin trial.
  - [Smooth and simple page transitions with the shared element transition API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/shared-element-transitions-for-spas/)
- I tried to come up with a fully featured CSS version and ended up with like 20 new properties and I wasn't even close.
  - There may be a CSS version of this, but it'd be a subset of the full capability.

- ## What's the difference between window.location and document.location in JavaScript?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2430936
- According to the W3C, they are the same. 
  - In reality, for cross browser safety, you should use `window.location` rather than `document.location` .

- ## If you're a fan of alert(), you may have heard about a change that briefly hit Chrome Stable channel this week (it's been temporarily disabled at the moment while breakage is remediated)
- https://twitter.com/estark37/status/1422694856544059396
  - The change is to disable alert(), confirm(), etc. inside cross-origin iframes. Sorry if this broke you!
- if you're wondering why this change is happening, the tl; dr is: alert() and friends are often used for spoofing(ÁîµÈÇÆÊ¨∫È™óÔºõÊªëÁ®ΩÊ®°‰ªø) and scams(Ê¨∫ËØàÈ™óÈí±) that take advantage of the fact that the message's provenance(Êù•Ê∫êÔºåÂá∫Â§Ñ) is ambiguous.
  - It's very easy to use alert() to trick a user into thinking their browser is telling them something when in fact the message is coming from a malicious website.

- ## JS and CSS modules with no build in sight!
- https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1403436100132110340
  - all built into the platform, no builds required, usable with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

- CSS modules is a very simple idea: import a CSSStyleSheet from a CSS file. Apply it to the document, or a shadow root for scoped styles.
  - They're great with web components already and a good building block for future features like importing class names and such from CSS into JS.
- What is the production perf implications of this? It seems
  1. CSS imported this way only loads when the importing js module is parsed (nested import chain)
  2. An app written this way results in many small requests to many small CSS files
  - Import as Constructable StyleSheet also means the CSS cannot be extracted and merged into a single file (worse compression). A build time optimization can only inline the CSS in JS - which means style changes invalidate js cache.
- Short-term, to bundle you'll have to go into JS.
  - With top-level await you can compile to the async `CSSStyleSheet.replace()` call so CSS parsing is non-blocking.
  - Long term we really need Web Bundles for this and so many reasons. Bundling by mutating and actually merging file contents is really bad for caching and tooling complexity, and only works for file formats where you can encode multiple files. CSS isn't one of those.
- I think tools could insert preload hints in parent bundles similar to what we do today to solve the first problem. Combining is harder when shadow DOM is involved‚Ä¶ another case for Resource Bundles I guess.

- ## Building upon "Import Assertions" we recently saw JSON Modules land in V8/Chromium 91__202104
- https://twitter.com/bramus/status/1421236658159112196
  - In Chromium 93 the same thing for CSS lands (‚ÄúCSS Modules‚Äù)
  - [CSS Modules V1 Explainer](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/css-modules-v1-explainer.md)

```JS
import json from './foo.json'
assert { type: 'json' };

import styles from "./styles.css"
assert { type: "css" };
```

- ## In new Chromium 92, PWAs can register themselves as handlers of custom URL protocols/ schemes using their installation manifest, making them all the more appy.

- ## Safari quirk: when an element has pointerCapture, the event's movementX and movementY will always be zero.

- ## CSS Module scripts were just merged into the HTML spec! __20210715
- https://twitter.com/justinfagnani/status/1415383208359645184
  - [Feature: CSS module scripts: ](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5948572598009856)
  - import styleSheet from "./styles.css" assert { type: "css" }; 
- how will this work in webpack or other bundlers? currently we import "style.css" and it adds it automatically or it's configured as a css-module. will this interfere with that?
  - Bundlers will have to adapt to the ever-evolving web platform as they always do.
  - I'm this case there's a straightforward transform to a JS module that exports a CSSStyleSheet. Later there may be more options around Web Bundles or multi-sheet CSS files.
  - I think with the import assertions, bundlers can use those as flags to fairly skip or delegate this process and then generate a chunk for the target file. But who knows Man shrugging, I'm still yet unsure if bundlers right now supports assertions.

- To be brutally honest, I think the "native CSS modules" standardization is rushed and again shows arrogance of those involved in the process.
- https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1427406150463537152
- clashes in naming with an popular existing solution (making search results confusing for beginners)
- uses the same syntax with popular existing conventions (extract via build tools)
- requires JavaScript (can't avoid FOUC)
- doesn't play nice with SSR
- doesn't scale in production (can result in hundreds of requests)
- All of which are non-issues for existing conventions! And the solution for the problem is more specs.
- Which begs the question: why rush it into a standard before the whole category of problems are thought through? Why such a hurry to standardize something that collides with existing conventions, yet doesn't even offer feature parity?

- I completely disagree that minimally useful is half-baked.

- ## Things I didn't know are apparently impossible ‚Äì positioning something exactly above the virtual keyboard on iOS Safari.
- https://twitter.com/tommoor/status/1420469267057844227
- You can use `window.visualViewport.height` .  (Try creating a new issue with a long description in linear for example)

- ## This week it was working around the fact that Safari dispatches two _mousemove_ events whenever you press a modifier key like Shift, Alt etc.
- https://twitter.com/brianskold/status/1420312185444601856
- whoa, is that per mouse move?
  - No, per key press. One on keydown, one on keyup.
- Safari fires a mousemove event on keydown/up if the key is shift, ctrl, alt, cmd etc, even if the mouse hasn't actually moved. 
  - Neither Chrome or Firefox do this. Safari doesn't do it for other keys.
- In Safari's defence, the MouseEvent objects have boolean properties for the state of those keys, so it's kinda sort-of reasonable to fire another event when that state changes.
  - But yeah, firing mousemove when the mouse didn't move feels weird.
