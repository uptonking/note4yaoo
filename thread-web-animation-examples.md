- ## Proof of concept: Spring animations with WebAnimations API
- https://twitter.com/mattgperry/status/1385937499478974465
  - This is driven synchronously by Popmotion, although there's downsides there's also a lot gained from this kind of approach. 
  - Pros/cons in the sandbox comments 
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/proof-of-concept-spring-animations-using-webanimations-api-2x6b5?file=/src/index.js
- pros
  - Minimal JS overhead, single animation to drive multiple values
  - Leverage browser interpolation rather than BYO (smaller bundle size)
  - Fallback to off-thread WebAnimations API for normal animations
- cons
  - No synchronous access the values makes this no good for useTransform or layout animations
  - No transferring velocity between animations. What is velocity anyway without direct access to the current interpolated values
  - Unclear how to support overshoot for more complex values (eg calc(50vw - 50%))
  - Synchronous JS. Less overhead than Framer Motion (1 animation per value) but not off-thread like WAAPI.
  - Every con is also currently true of Animation Worklet .
- Have you tried animation worklets?
  - Yeah there's some experimental code in Popmotion from my hacking around.if we're going off-thread I'd rather a very low level, Reanimated 1-style API to start
- Great work! Such a shame there's no perfromant physics animation API baked into the platform.
- Interesting. WAAPI is great because literally no work is happening on the main thread. Repeatedly setting currentTime on the main thread looks no different from just using JS for everything. Why would I want to do it this way?

- https://x.com/mattgperry/status/1874406487742886000
- I believe there are bugs in both Chrome and Safari:
  - Chrome/Blink uses "none" in the to keyframe
  - Safari/WebKit uses the same value as the from keyframe in the to keyframe

- ## With tools like @LottieFiles , @rive_app , and @jittervideo designers can easily integrate smooth, lightweight animations.

- What tool did you use for this animations?
  - You can use Lottie, Rive, After effect or Jitter

- ## 🌰 Everyone’s doing this trendy hero effect with a plain `<video>` tag. 
- https://x.com/konstipaulus/status/1954539977812980030
  - I tried it with WebCodecs for extra performance.
  - 1. Generated the first frame with Flux.1 Kontext Max → upscaled with Real-ESRGAN.
  - 2. Used Seedance 1 Lite to experiment with image-to-video prompts
  - 3. Demuxed the video in-browser with mediabunny > decoded frames using a VideoDecoder instance > painted them via Canvas 2D Context API.
- https://github.com/diffusionstudio/webcodecs-scroll-sync /MIT/202508/ts
  - A video decoder that synchronizes video playback with scroll position using the WebCodecs API.

- Interesting approach.  Is WebCodecs support wide enough yet?  Performance gains would be compelling if so.
  - Yes it’s supported in all major browsers except Firefox on Android. We’re still working on getting some inconsistencies resolved though.

- looks so laggy
  - The screen recording software I used significantly reduced the performance for some reason

- The text receding as if it were placed three-dimensionally is a lovely touch

- anything that hijacks scroll is no-go for me

- ## You can actually achieve spring animations using the WAAPI. 
- https://twitter.com/okikio_dev/status/1415314400253206528
  - https://codepen.io/okikio/pen/abJMWNy
- The demo uses [@okikio/animate](https://github.com/okikio/native/tree/master/packages/animate), but you don't really need it to creative spring animations
  - https://okikio.github.io/native/demo/animate.html
  - It utilizes the Web Animation API to deliver butter smooth animations at a small size, it weighs ~11.6 KB
  - In @okikio/animate, I create tweenAttr which used WAAPI together with rAF to emulate individual transforms for svg and other attribute transforms
