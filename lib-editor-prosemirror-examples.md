# lib-editor-prosemirror-examples

# guide

- 编辑器的架构模块: model(包含selection)/view/commands

- prosemirror-futuristic
  - 方向：collab、markdown、pivot-table、math/formula、media/embed、cms
  - 大部分的方案是以vanillajs为core，react为wrapper
  - toys
    - 尝试保留rich-markdown-editor的api，将core用~~tiptap~~重写
    - 尝试用atlassian editor重写outline，抽象出可替换编辑器的接口，考虑可替换的协作同步方案
    - react indexeddb， 编辑器数据频繁的更新可参考编辑器实时协作的更新

- vanillajs-first
  - tiptap/blocknote/novel/dante/wix, guardian, tui.editor.v3, stacks-editor, bangle.dev
  - milkdown(Typora), jcmnunes-bc-editor(md)
- react-first
  - nytimes, remirror, @atlaskit/editor-core, yandex-yfm, syllepsis(字节)
  - wax-prosemirror(coko), manuscript-editor, curvenote-editor(redux), rich-markdown-editor

- more-prosemirror
  - pageboard/client(页面搭建), noteworthy(solidjs)
  - 建站编辑器应该参考gutenberg、wix

  - 🆚️ [how is it different from Remirror, Prosemirror or Tiptap? _202412](https://github.com/prosekit/prosekit/discussions/857)
    - Remirror and TipTap share some similar designs. One of them is that every extension is a class (e.g., BoldExtension). If you want to add more features based on an existing extension, you extend it (e.g., class MyBoldExtension extends BoldExtension) and add/override methods in the subclass.
    - I found this design makes it harder to use in complex scenarios. Using the principle of "composition over inheritance," I redesigned the extension system in ProseKit, where every extension is just a function that calls one or more other extensions.
    - I also made some other improvements, like simpler lifecycle management and more UI library (Svelte, SolidJS, etc.) support.
    - Sadly, these changes are so significant that I won't be able to publish them as a new major version of the existing Remirror project, so I created ProseKit.

- guardian-prosemirror-elements /37Star/MIT/202311/ts
  - https://github.com/guardian/prosemirror-elements
  - This Prosemirror plugin adds the ability to add custom 'elements' to a document.
  - 使用prosemirror编辑器作为NodeViews，嵌套多实例编辑器
  - Prosemirror-elements provides a way of expressing an Element and its Fields in the UI framework of your choice, and we provide React bindings as a default.
  - What is an Element?
    - Modelling non-text content in Prosemirror can be tricky. 
    - Elements contain user-defined Fields that can model many different kinds of content, including rich text fields and arbitrary data.
    - Each Element is made up of Fields, which represent a data type – for example, text, rich text, or custom data types.

- https://github.com/handlewithcarecollective/react-prosemirror /apache2/202501/ts
  - A fully featured library for safely integrating ProseMirror and React.
  - On Jan. 17, 2025, the maintainers of the @nytimes/react-prosemirror library decided fork the v2 release into its own project. It had been developed entirely by one developer, @smoores-dev, who had not worked for NYT in years
  - It's also challenging to effectively use React to define node views for ProseMirror documents. Both ProseMirror and React expect to have full control over their respective parts of the DOM. They both modify and destroy DOM nodes as needed. Previous solutions (including previous iterations of this library) have attempted to work around this power struggle by producing wrapper elements to hand to ProseMirror, and then mounting React nodes within these (usually with React Portals).
    - This approach works, but tenuously. Having additional nodes in the document that ProseMirror isn't strictly aware of can cause issues with its change detection system, leading to challenging edge cases. [Deleting the last node view can throw errors · Issue · nytimes/react-prosemirror _202306](https://github.com/nytimes/react-prosemirror/issues/42)
  - 💡 This library provides an alternate implementation of ProseMirror's `EditorView`. It uses React as the rendering engine, rather than ProseMirror's home-brewed DOM update system. This allows us to provide a more comfortable integration with ProseMirror's powerful data model, transformations, and event management systems.
    - the new release moves rendering responsibility entirely into React. We disabled the EditorView's DOM update cycle, and implemented the same update algorithm that prosemirror-view uses with React components. The result is a more idiomatic, React-based library, which doesn't have any of the issues of the original implementation.

  - [The Future of @nytimes/react-prosemirror_202309](https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/the-future-of-nytimes-react-prosemirror/5855)
    - For the past several months, I’ve been hard at work on a very different approach to integrate React and ProseMirror. 
    - The summary is this: the new approach completely replaces ProseMirror’s DOM management system with one built in React. 
    - We’re still using `prosemirror-view` for everything outside of change detection and DOM updates, which means we are exposing exactly the same API. 
    - In fact, I’ve ported over most of the unit tests from prosemirror-view to ensure that behavior matches the default library.
  - ProseMirror View library renders ProseMirror documents in a single-phase update. 
  - The first phase of a React update should be free of side effects, which requires that updates to the ProseMirror View happen in the second phase.
    - during the first phase, React components actually have access to a different (newer) version of the EditorState than the one in the Editorview. 
    - As a result code that dispatches transactions may dispatch transactions based on incorrect state. 
  - 💡 There are two different directions to integrate ProseMirror and React: 
    - you can render a ProseMirror EditorView inside of a React component, 
    - and you can use React components to render ProseMirror NodeViews. 
    - This library provides tools for accomplishing both of these goals.

  - [Manuscripts.io is a ProseMirror-based editor in a React application _202011](https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/manuscripts-io/3299), 
    - served as a PWA that works offline and can be installed as a desktop application via Chrome.
    - instead of using ProseMirror’s standard collaboration plugin, 👉🏻 Manuscripts serializes each block of the document to a JSON object with an id, which is stored in the browser’s local storage (IndexedDB) using RxDB/PouchDB and then synced with Couchbase via Sync Gateway, which handles permissions and validates each object according to a defined schema. 
    - Manuscripts.io is built by a team within Atypon; Atypon成立于1996年，是一家为全球期刊发展服务的软件系统公司，Atypon旗下出版平台Literatum为全球近100000本期刊和919家出版商网站、45%的英文同行评审学术期刊和其他语种的出版物提供服务。
    - Conflict resolution is handled in each client, with any conflicting changes in the document’s content presented to the user for them to choose the most appropriate resolution.
    - Collaboration in Manuscripts.io works at the project level — each project can contain several manuscripts — and collaborators can either be responsible for editing parts of the document or can simply comment by adding annotations to blocks or ranges of the manuscript.
    - Manuscripts.io includes some innovations: figures that can be (re)generated dynamically by evaluating code in a hosted Jupyter kernel; built-in searching of online reference databases; configurable paragraph, section and inline styles, and output to multiple formats (DOCX, PDF, JATS XML, HTML, and others).

  - Web word processor for 2Tale Writer's Portal.
  - ✨ 未使用contenteditable，基于dom实现排版，支持显示分页； 
    - 自定义排版还可参考 dropflow，但输出canvas
  - core无依赖，react封装很少(只有2个文件)，不依赖prosemirror
  - 大量使用es6 class
  - 自己实现了依赖注入，设计了model/service/component
  - 该项目是作为2Tale Writer's Portal的核心编辑器来开发的。
  - 项目的目标是保持编辑器核心的最小化和可扩展性，覆盖必要的功能以便有机会将其扩展到更具体的用例中。
  - 目前有相当多的开源所见即所得（WYSIWYG）的编辑器，使用ContentEditable特性提供编辑界面。这些编辑器同时可以充分利用CSS和浏览器的布局引擎去渲染和修饰文档的样式。
  - 因为浏览器关注的是布局和渲染，所以这些编辑器不清楚内容会渲染在什么地方，这在大多数场景下是可以接受的。然而，当你开发一个依赖布局信息的功能的时候，你可能会遇到一个不能跨越的障碍。
  - 一个很常见的场景就是目前这些开源编辑器不能对文字进行分页处理。要实现这一特性，需要在确定何处分页之前就知道文档是如何被拆分成一行一行的，并且知道每行的尺寸和位置。像谷歌Doc这种有分页功能的商业的云服务文字处理是通过研发自有排版引擎来达到目标的。
  - Taleweaver 拥有排版引擎同时提供了一套API来访问排版信息。它的目标就是把word那种风格的文字编辑体验带到开源社区。
  - Taleweaver的工作原理是获取文档状态并将其呈现到屏幕上。当状态发生变化时，这些更改将通过一系列步骤传播到屏幕。
    - [State] -> [Model Tree] -> [Render Tree] -> [Layout Tree] -> [View Tree]

    - I wanted paginated documents, which requires breaking up pages at equal heights. This cannot be done efficiently with editors like ProseMirror because we need to know the position and height of each line in order to produce pages.
    - I don't have prior experience with building word processors, much of the project's design has been trial and error.
    - There are 2 features that I'm still trying to figure out, with no satisfactory solution so far: Pasting, Text formatting

  - Drag and drop the quotes (powered by react-beautiful-dnd) onto this Remirror editor
  - whilst Remirror does support native drag-n-drop events, it doesn't support react-beautiful-dnds Draggables.
  - Our react-beautiful-dnd based solution requires lots of workarounds, that could be confusing to maintain.
    - If your use case for drag-n-drop behaviour is simple, it may be more worthwhile to remove react-beautiful-dnd's abstraction layer, and use the native implementation instead.
