- ## Does any static site generator have a market for themes and/or people that sell themes for it?
- https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1410627179772354565
- https://themeforest.net/search/gatsby

- ## 宇树科技推出了面向普通消费者的机器狗，售价1.6万~2万人民币，天猫现在就能预订，10月之前发货。
- https://twitter.com/ruanyf/status/1410769253972647939
  - 这个机器狗能够自主跟随和避障，有强大的保持平衡能力，跌倒可以爬起来。价格只有波士顿动力公司同类产品的十分之一

- ## What are some visual application builders for the web where you only have a limited range of built-in components but they’re all high-level (e.g. grid/list that can bind to data)? Like Access+VBA but for today
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1410342969786486786
- Some listed here - Airtable is the closest match to Access
- Retool, they basically advertise themselves as VBA but in the context of the cloud + browser + JS
- @builderio is! Specifically our "components-only mode"
- http://openchakra.app
  - Components are limited to those available in the source library, and styling options are limited to those tokens found in the theme
- I wanna say https://editorx.com. You get collection components (grid, list, repeater) which you can bind to data. You can even add buttons, select events, and it will create and bind empty fns - just like VB of yore.
- I used to use @xojo for software development. It has it's own flavor of VB, has a good community, and is pretty good!

- ## kind of want to start a consultancy where someone describes their data in detail and i recommend which visualization techniques are appropriate, 
- https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1409317416665026563
  - this should exist, at least someone should do this. 
  - just narrowing down the appropriate types would do so much good in the world.
- Unfortunately it’s usually the other way round… “hey, we really want this cool data visualization to communicate the data”. Plot twist: there is no data. 
- You should get paid just to find every time someone tries to put a 3D pie-chart into a PowerPoint and tell them no

- ## 家具定制怎么没有低端定制的，
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1409321600663441415
  - 比如我只需要用 iPhone 的 LiDAR 扫一扫房间，App 自动生成房间 CAD 图，AI 自动生成装修方案，用户选一个后，下单到工厂，工厂用最便宜的合成板加工出家具，寄给用户。年轻人租房也能拥有品质不低的生活。
  - 大家需要吗，需要的话我回老家菏泽搞一个，菏泽到处都是家具厂，500块，不，200块就能搞一个定制大柜子
- iPhone测量不精确，留条缝或者塞不下都很尴尬
  - 低端定制要求什么严丝合缝
  - 然后就会发现iphone扫出来的尺寸差了2厘米，柜子放不进去白做了。
- 最大的问题在用户身上，这个测量设计的误差因为用户原因可能会很大。不可靠因素太多了。
- 家具定制都是派人上门用手持激光测距仪测量各种尺寸的。。别的不准。。
- 年轻人根本不需要订制，买预制就好了，反正是租房说不定还能搬下一个房子，何苦要订制？
- 淘宝上的标化成品家具，闲鱼的二手家具，宜家这种环保性好一些的一次性家具，都是面向租房市场的解决方案。
- 库克看了你这条推文马上就整个Apple Furniture
- 定制的生产成本比规模化生产更高，哪怕用最便宜材料定制，也不见得比普通材料的量产成本低，所以订制只能走高端的
- 目前你在淘宝能买到的家具，就有很多菏泽货，这就是零售能做到的最低价。而且不含定制成本。
  - 如果你能做到比什么维莎、原始原素等大型低端品牌价格更低，那必然是超过马斯克的商业奇才。
- 室内装修一般都是这样的，都是上门去丈量定做。我觉得没你想的这么简单，虽然实现的方案是可行的，我觉得。

- ## “自动合影机”，可以挑选自己喜欢的体育明星合影。
- https://twitter.com/ruanyf/status/1408412534474874883

- ## This riderless bike took about four months to be made and it's almost totally open source[hardware and structure on github]
- https://twitter.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1406207562924630016
  - 自动行驶的自行车
  - http://www.pengzhihui.xyz/
- Clearly it's the wow factor. I actually found riding adult sized tricycles less stable than bicycles. 
- Good for people with no arms or the blind.

- ## Unpopular opinion: reproducible presentations (e.g., R Markdown Xaringan, Jupyter Rise, etc) are easier than WSWYG ones (e.g., Powerpoint, Keynote)
- https://twitter.com/TiffanyTimbers/status/1404823614596128768
  - I don't stand by this 100% of the time, but I do most of the time. When do I choose a WSWYG presentation tool? When there is no analysis involved, & for short, one-off presentations. 
- I have never used WYSWYG because I learn LaTeX before I needed to write my first presentation. Always LaTeX (reports, presentations, posters, journal articles, ...), with knitr if data analysis is involved 
- IMHO best is very background dependent. In general, only a small fraction of my presentations relate to actual results, while most is background and implications. I do like Rmarkdown for automatic analysis updates or standard analysis templates.

- ## Automatically fill your Notion database from events on your website.

- ## Life as a developer in 2021
- https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1400804133158989825
  - Current tech company: you’ve done an excellent job this year, here’s a 4% raise.
  - Developer’s email inbox: here are 700 offers for 200% of what you’re making in your current role.
  - Amazon: you’re in the top 5% of the entire company, nice work comrade.
- I'm not a developer yet, but I work in IT and this is exactly what happened. I'm getting a 20k a year raise with the new job I'm about to start, and my current company refuses to even give raises. I'm also in an area where the talent is extremely hard to find lol. Oops
- Someone I know was recently promoted to Principal Engineer and it came with a whopping 4% raise. The company's also really stingy with their equity, so I wouldn't be surprised if the 4% was itself 100% of the increase.

- ## we kind of had webmail before 2004, but webmail didn't become A Thing until gmail. 
- https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1395548128087003146
  - browser-based IDEs are about to become A Thing, with all that entails (security, live collab, zero install, etc)
- I don't think StackBlitz is the final word here — 
  - they've basically just invented a new market (previous browser IDEs were more tech demo than useful product, IMHO, at least once you get beyond building toys)
- Cloud9, Github Codespaces, etc. all seem like full-featured products that have been used by people who preferred browser-based development, but apparently they remained niche(市场定位；生态位). The only difference I see here is better offline support, and... idk if it's enough.
  - I mean, it's definitely cool, and I like this idea as well as all the IDEs before it, but don't see what changed drastically market-wise.
- biggest difference i see is that the browser run everything, instead of being a thick client for a proprietary backend. (but yeah, not sure what node brings here other than npm ecosystem compat).
- The drastic change is in the performance you can expect from a local runtime vs a server you're sharing with a bunch of other people in who-knows-what region. I've generally found cloud IDEs unusable, latency/perf wise

- ## I've been thinking a lot in the last few days, how a code editor/IDE focused on React could looks like. So it brings me to this
- https://twitter.com/danilowoz/status/1393212141122031621
  - 在行号左边有一列操作拦，可以拖拽移动一行代码

- ## Just use @splitbee and make your analytics dashboard public
- https://twitter.com/peduarte/status/1390930597942636544
- https://app.splitbee.io/public/mxstbr.com
- Sorry to hijack this convo, but are there any docs or examples for A/B testing with @splitbee ? 
  - I'm struggling to find some I'm happy with Plausible but willing to give Splitbee a go for A/B testing!
- I think Splitbee looks great, but in case you missed you can make your Fathom analytics public too

- ## Product GIFs are your best friend.
- https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725794063331333
  - If you have a SaaS or DTC product, show don't tell. Give us action shots.
- Don't really use GIF, though. 
  - Video formats tend to be more efficient at playing video, and you can achieve the same look and feel with the right HTML markup (most GIFs platforms use mp4 videos under the hood).

- ## What are your thoughts on-sponsors-only (Sponsorware) open source and npm packages?
- https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone/status/1389833727564451845
- How would that be different than non-oss paid products?
  - I think you'd be better off talking about it as a product people can buy (including the source) than calling it sponsorware. 

- ## Unpopular opinion but true: Google Docs blows chunks for user experience.
- https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1386764214874824706
- Word: "90% of users use 10% of the features"
  - Docs: "here's 10%"
- Try Google Sheets on an iPad. It’s a whole different level of WTF.
- Sometimes worse is better. Google Docs does low-friction collaboration better than anyone -- just send them a URL. 
  - iWork can run it 60fps and be fluid AF, but if you need to pick a random stranger to collab with, good luck.
  - I use Keynote 4 my own prezos, but Docs for collab.
- The entire G-suite is terrible. I've replaced everything with standalone apps where I can -- sadly no good solution for GDocs.
- Try using Microsoft Sharepoint and you'll come crawling back
- Funny, we experienced completely the opposite at work.
