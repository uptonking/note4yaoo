- ## Life as a developer in 2021
- https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1400804133158989825
  - Current tech company: you’ve done an excellent job this year, here’s a 4% raise.
  - Developer’s email inbox: here are 700 offers for 200% of what you’re making in your current role.
  - Amazon: you’re in the top 5% of the entire company, nice work comrade.
- I'm not a developer yet, but I work in IT and this is exactly what happened. I'm getting a 20k a year raise with the new job I'm about to start, and my current company refuses to even give raises. I'm also in an area where the talent is extremely hard to find lol. Oops
- Someone I know was recently promoted to Principal Engineer and it came with a whopping 4% raise. The company's also really stingy with their equity, so I wouldn't be surprised if the 4% was itself 100% of the increase.

- ## we kind of had webmail before 2004, but webmail didn't become A Thing until gmail. 
- https://twitter.com/Rich_Harris/status/1395548128087003146
  - browser-based IDEs are about to become A Thing, with all that entails (security, live collab, zero install, etc)
- I don't think StackBlitz is the final word here — 
  - they've basically just invented a new market (previous browser IDEs were more tech demo than useful product, IMHO, at least once you get beyond building toys)
- Cloud9, Github Codespaces, etc. all seem like full-featured products that have been used by people who preferred browser-based development, but apparently they remained niche(市场定位；生态位). The only difference I see here is better offline support, and... idk if it's enough.
  - I mean, it's definitely cool, and I like this idea as well as all the IDEs before it, but don't see what changed drastically market-wise.
- biggest difference i see is that the browser run everything, instead of being a thick client for a proprietary backend. (but yeah, not sure what node brings here other than npm ecosystem compat).
- The drastic change is in the performance you can expect from a local runtime vs a server you're sharing with a bunch of other people in who-knows-what region. I've generally found cloud IDEs unusable, latency/perf wise

- ## I've been thinking a lot in the last few days, how a code editor/IDE focused on React could looks like. So it brings me to this

  - 在行号左边有一列操作拦，可以拖拽移动一行代码

- ## Just use @splitbee and make your analytics dashboard public
- https://twitter.com/peduarte/status/1390930597942636544
- https://app.splitbee.io/public/mxstbr.com
- Sorry to hijack this convo, but are there any docs or examples for A/B testing with @splitbee ? 
  - I'm struggling to find some I'm happy with Plausible but willing to give Splitbee a go for A/B testing!
- I think Splitbee looks great, but in case you missed you can make your Fathom analytics public too

- ## Product GIFs are your best friend.
- https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1389725794063331333
  - If you have a SaaS or DTC product, show don't tell. Give us action shots.
- Don't really use GIF, though. 
  - Video formats tend to be more efficient at playing video, and you can achieve the same look and feel with the right HTML markup (most GIFs platforms use mp4 videos under the hood).

- ## What are your thoughts on-sponsors-only (Sponsorware) open source and npm packages?
- https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone/status/1389833727564451845
- How would that be different than non-oss paid products?
  - I think you'd be better off talking about it as a product people can buy (including the source) than calling it sponsorware. 

- ## Unpopular opinion but true: Google Docs blows chunks for user experience.
- https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1386764214874824706
- Word: "90% of users use 10% of the features"
  - Docs: "here's 10%"
- Try Google Sheets on an iPad. It’s a whole different level of WTF.
- Sometimes worse is better. Google Docs does low-friction collaboration better than anyone -- just send them a URL. 
  - iWork can run it 60fps and be fluid AF, but if you need to pick a random stranger to collab with, good luck.
  - I use Keynote 4 my own prezos, but Docs for collab.
- The entire G-suite is terrible. I've replaced everything with standalone apps where I can -- sadly no good solution for GDocs.
- Try using Microsoft Sharepoint and you'll come crawling back
- Funny, we experienced completely the opposite at work.
