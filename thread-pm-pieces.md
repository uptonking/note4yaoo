- ## Product GIFs are your best friend.

  - If you have a SaaS or DTC product, show don't tell. Give us action shots.
- Don't really use GIF, though. 
  - Video formats tend to be more efficient at playing video, and you can achieve the same look and feel with the right HTML markup (most GIFs platforms use mp4 videos under the hood).

- ## What are your thoughts on-sponsors-only (Sponsorware) open source and npm packages?
- https://twitter.com/giuseppegurgone/status/1389833727564451845
- How would that be different than non-oss paid products?
  - I think you'd be better off talking about it as a product people can buy (including the source) than calling it sponsorware. 

- ## Unpopular opinion but true: Google Docs blows chunks for user experience.
- https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1386764214874824706
- Word: "90% of users use 10% of the features"
  - Docs: "here's 10%"
- Try Google Sheets on an iPad. Itâ€™s a whole different level of WTF.
- Sometimes worse is better. Google Docs does low-friction collaboration better than anyone -- just send them a URL. 
  - iWork can run it 60fps and be fluid AF, but if you need to pick a random stranger to collab with, good luck.
  - I use Keynote 4 my own prezos, but Docs for collab.
- The entire G-suite is terrible. I've replaced everything with standalone apps where I can -- sadly no good solution for GDocs.
- Try using Microsoft Sharepoint and you'll come crawling back
- Funny, we experienced completely the opposite at work.
