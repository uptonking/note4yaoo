- ## 

- ##  I found Notion is the one-stop solution for all note-taking purposes 
- https://twitter.com/iamrohitgund/status/1325229159027630080
  - but only one problem I faced is that I can't copy tables to Microsoft Word or other platforms. 
  - If there is any way to do that I can shift 100% from Evernote, Microsoft To-do, etc
- Our(Notion's) tables are databases, not spreadsheets, so there's some fundamental differences compared to other programs.
  - That being said, you should be able to copy + paste into a spreadsheet. 
  - You can also export content as .csv!

- ## Unpopular opinion but true: Google Docs blows chunks for user experience.
- https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1386764214874824706
- Word: "90% of users use 10% of the features"
  - Docs: "here's 10%"
- Try Google Sheets on an iPad. Itâ€™s a whole different level of WTF.
- Sometimes worse is better. Google Docs does low-friction collaboration better than anyone -- just send them a URL. 
  - iWork can run it 60fps and be fluid AF, but if you need to pick a random stranger to collab with, good luck.
  - I use Keynote 4 my own prezos, but Docs for collab.
- The entire G-suite is terrible. I've replaced everything with standalone apps where I can -- sadly no good solution for GDocs.
- Try using Microsoft Sharepoint and you'll come crawling back
- Funny, we experienced completely the opposite at work.
