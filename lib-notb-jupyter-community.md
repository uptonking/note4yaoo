- ## I just released Jupyter Shared Drive _20240824
- https://x.com/davidbrochart/status/1827087377086513330
  - This is a new way of collaborating in real-time in JupyterLab. Unlike Jupyter Collaboration, it is separate from your local files. See it as a scratch disk where you temporarily share files with colleagues.
  - pip install jupyter-shared-drive
  - The shared files don't live in a central place, but in each browser. This is a distributed architecture, think of it as a peer-to-peer application like BitTorrent. 
  - And since it's based on WebRTC, it will also work in JupyterLite! A signaling server is needed for connecting users.
