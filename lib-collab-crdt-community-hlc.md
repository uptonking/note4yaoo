- ## guests say that they don't need CRDTs b/c they're "too complex" but then go on to explain their custom solution which is... a CRDT

- I've been guilty of similar things in the past. "That paper looks long. I'll just implement my idea." Some time later: "Oh.. I just implemented a worse version of what was in that paper"
- I've seen data synchronization code in a real app that looked exactly like a CRDT merge function, but the authors never heard or know anything about the CRDT literature and lattice algebra. It was much more complex than it should have been though.
