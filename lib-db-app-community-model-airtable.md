- I wonder the database structure behind airtable-like flexible data apps. I suppose they would create databases and tables on the fly to increase performance - or maybe they just use unstructured (or flexibly structured) databases like mongodb?
- Maybe something similar to a triple store.

- I use Airtable for my job, mostly as a project management application. This may be an unusual use case, but I find myself limited at many times.
  - It's almost like nobody at Airtable pays attention to the design of features. Everything is so limited. Blocks are an incredibly useful idea, but in practice uncustomizable and not something I find helpful.

- There is one lurking competitor to Airtable that no one knows: Notion.
  - Except Notion is far more capable than Airtable. You can do all these table joins across pages but in Notion everything is a page whereas in Airtable it's just a form. That is the ultimate flexibility which makes it exceptionally well suited for any kind planning effort. And it's a great canvas for creative projects.
  - Plus Notion has some of the best customer service around. Half the company are there for support!

- Coda is more capable in other ways - I can summon up chats of my data and define new formulas. I love that buttons let me effectively create a little webapp that also works beautifully on mobile.

- It's a database primarily operated upon using a spreadsheet interface. You can create different representations (literally Views) of your data / rows. You can add custom logic "blocks" to rows / entries / tables that, for example, send a text message to a customer in the table.
  - You're not going to build a brand new consumer app on Airtable, but all of the backoffice and internal crap we write over and over and over again... it's a really good option for simplifying those processes and is accessible to non-developers.
