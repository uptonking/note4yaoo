- ## [File attachment in the card](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/pull/4053)
- This PR adds the functionality to attach files of any type to the card.
- Based on the P1 requirements of this spec. 
  - I don't think "attachments" should be part of the `Content` or be considered `ContentBlocks` . 
  - They are displayed in their own section and to me are separate items, more similar to `Comments` than `Content` .
