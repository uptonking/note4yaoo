- ## üåêÔ∏è [Add multilingual support](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/issues/5)
- Multiple designs possible:
  - One SUMMARY.md to rule them all
  - One SUMMARY.md for every language

- My suggestion is to have "one SUMMARY.md per language", but support page-to-page cross-linking between the different languages. 
  - The easiest way to do this is to consider that the files with the same name are the same chapters. In 99% this should work. 
  - A more complex way to do this is to add some kind of identifier to each file (something like UUID). If the identifiers of the files are identical, we can cross-link them.

- I've released a version 0.2 of mdbook-i18n-helpers._202308
