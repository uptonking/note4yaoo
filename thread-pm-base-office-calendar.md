- ## 

- ## From 2024 onwards, the lines between Calendar and Task Management apps will start to blur.

- Which tools are the one in the exact centre?
  - Akiflow, Motion
- I see your point, but the only reason I like apps like @culturedcode and @basecamp is the fact they do one thing well.. Managing to-dos.
- if Google is going to make the todo list part of Google Calendar + Tasks more usable and feature-rich, it will swipe away so many apps. do you think this is going to happen?

- ## A calendar app that lets me slice my time by different facets:
- https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1622729235029954560
  - Focus time vs meetings
  - Different projects
  - Zoom vs in-person (v different energy dynamics!)
  - Stress level (casual chat vs intense meeting)
  - Fixed vs flexible commitments
- You can do this in a simple, flexible, and extensible way with @coda_hq . 
  - One way, would be to have each row in a table be a calendar event. 
  - Then you can have columns with tags, sliders (for stress levels), etc. 
  - Then you can make filtered views & graphical representation.

- Maybe notion will eventually integrate cron, and you can filter and sort it, the way you would any database
- I've been having fun using http://reclaim.ai for some of this!
  - basic work vs personal slicing
  - the best I've seen for flexible habits auto scheduling
  - a filter to avoid stacking things too! (I use it to avoid stacking workout types on the same day)
