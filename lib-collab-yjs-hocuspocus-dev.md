- If you are trying to deploy Hocuspocus in a HA setup or solve issues due to too many connections / network traffic, you can use our redis extension: extension-redis.
- if you're having issues about cpu / memory usage, our suggested solution at the moment is to deploy multiple independent Hocuspocus instances and split users by a document identifier.
