- ## But first be able to explain why you don't like passing props multiple levels

- Also, explain why you're creating so many component layers when a single component will do just fine.
  - From experience, it's probably because their components import their own child components directly rather than accepting children as props.
  - I think it has to do with your approach. I fell into the trap at first of trying to make a neat little component for every box on the page
  - Nowadays I always start with a single component and take the top-down approach. Don't create a new component until I absolutely need to
  - Having lots of small components for page layout is amazingly expressive, they just need to be composable, accepting children as props.
    - Building out a living style guide of React components is a great way to force this architecture.
    - I've been working on something like this these last of couple months and it is an amazing workflow.
    - With well thought out component APIs, updates are a breeze. I absolutely love it.
- This is why I love the render prop on Route so much. No need for extra components just for URLs
  - I've been thinking on this angle for glamor/ the css prop/ programming workflow in general. when it's make it work -> make it right.
  - I tend to get to prod faster, but if I try to make my abstractions before making *something* work, I tend to have a bad time. 
  - Exactly. Problem with Just JavaScript is our tolerance for big classes is way less than big templates. Have to fight the abstraction urge.
