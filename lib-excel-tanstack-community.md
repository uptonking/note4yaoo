- ## bling: new javascript framework?
- We're currently working on a prototype right now.
- FYI, all of the start code will be in the router repo for now, under a new package
- https://github.com/winter-things/winterkit
  - The primary motivation for this project is to build a foundation for server-side Javascript frameworks. The goal is to provide a set of tools that can be used to build a framework that is easy to use, easy to extend, and they don't have to maintain it
- Why?
  - Each modern framework is slowly adopting the Web Fetch API as the server runtime API along with other Web Standard APIs. This is an awesome direction for the web and an amazing foundation for full-stack Javascript apps to be built on.
  - There is a lot of duplicate work that a bunch of frameworks like SolidStart, Remix, SvelteKit, Astro, QwikCity, Nuxt, Next have done to support the Web Fetch API.
  - The challenge is the variety of Javascript server runtimes available for developers to use: Node (Docker, Fly), deno, bun, Cloudflare Workers/Pages, Vercel Serverless/Edge
