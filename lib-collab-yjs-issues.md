- ## [Extending Yjs Types without breaking everything - Yjs Community _202110](https://discuss.yjs.dev/t/extending-yjs-types-without-breaking-everything/769)
  - I came with the idea to create custom Yjs types to extends defaults shared types methods and to get a better type experience DX, code clarity etc.
- I tackled this via composition rather than inheritance, as I ran into similar roadblocks.

- The way I have “solved” it temporarily is… instead of using inheritance:
  - Extend the prototype:
  - Y. XmlElement.prototype.myMethod = ()=>{}
