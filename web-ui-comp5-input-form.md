# guide
- form设计
  - form提交后，若请求处理失败，应该保持旧的输入记录方便用户直接修改，而不是展示空白form让用户重新输入
# switch

## [Switch Pattern | APG | WAI | W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/switch/)

- switches can only be used for binary input while checkboxes and toggle buttons allow implementations the option of supporting a third middle state. 

- it is critical the label on a switch does not change when its state changes.

- If the switch element is an HTML `input[type="checkbox"]`, it uses the HTML `checked` attribute instead of the `aria-checked` property.

- ## [Building a switch component](https://web.dev/building-a-switch-component/)
- This demo uses `<input type="checkbox" role="switch">` for the majority of its functionality, which has the advantage of not needing CSS or JavaScript to be fully functional and accessible.

- https://github.com/argyleink/gui-challenges/blob/main/switch/style.css

- ## [Build an accessible Switch Component with React and Typescript.](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/build-an-accessible-switch-component-with-react-and-typescript-d455a405aaa)
- HTML unfortunately does not support native switch elements. 
  - We can opt for a simple `<input type="checkbox" role="switch" />`, remove all default browser styles using the CSS declaration `appearance: none;` and apply our own custom styles

- ## [The good, the bad and the toggle.](https://uxdesign.cc/the-good-the-bad-and-the-toggle-2abc0fbbd099)
- Do not use toggles in forms. Use checkboxes or radio buttons instead.
- Do not use toggles in filters or multiple selections of elements.
- Use toggles for settings and changes that have an immediate effect on the UI (same applies for the segmented control).
- Avoid mixing toggle button groups and segmented controls.
- Avoid using switches with multiple options.

- ### [Checkbox or switch?](https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/checkbox-or-switch-97dd932b01c0)
- If the actions rely on each other, for instance, choosing one will choose the others as well, then use checkbox
- Switch takes more space, and this big space provides more design possibilities.
- There are gaps between guidelines and actual practices

- ## I only just learned about `HTMLInputElement.valueAsNumber` and I'm baffled(困惑；难倒). Is this the Mandela effect or something
- https://twitter.com/gaforres/status/1730658548764602636
- `valueAsDate` also for date inputs. Not just getters either, but setters too!

- ## Tip: number inputs have a `valueAsNumber` property, which allows you to quickly get their numeric value 
- https://twitter.com/mgechev/status/1429662217318850560
  - use `input.valueAsNumber` instead of `parseInt(input.value)`

- ## 🌰 [A Better Way to Work With Number and Date Inputs in JavaScript](https://www.builder.io/blog/numbers-and-dates)

```JS
const myInput = document.querySelector('input.my-input')
const number = myInput.valueAsNumber
const date = myDateInput.valueAsDate
```

- ## Forms tip
- https://twitter.com/stackblitz/status/1412414470681415682
- Checkbox can be indeterminate, but you have to set that( `inputEl.intdeterminate = true` ) with JavaScript.
- `autocomplete="one-time-code"` can help users auto-fill the auth code they've just received - they won't need to copy it from the SMS by hand!
  - one-time-code requires an OS-level integration (eg works on Safari+Mac, but won't on Android)
- The `<fieldset>` element – used for grouping relevant inputs & buttons – allows you to provide the `disabled` attribute if you want to disable these enclosed controls all at once.
- Use `<datalist>` to enhance your forms with suggested values – not only for text inputs, but also numbers, ranges, emails, and even colors!
- You *can* customize these native html validation messages that browsers display. Just use the `setCustomValidity` method! Super useful for working with pattern validation, or even just to say "Name is required"
- Use the built-in `.validationMessage` property that allows you to get a native validation message (in your user's locale!), and display it in the UI the way you like it.
- Working with date inputs use the `valueAsDate` property so you don't have to manually convert between "YYYY-MM-DD" string and a `Date` object.
  - Useful for both getting, and settings the value!

- ## How to use JavaScript's FormData to collect form fields without refs or state
- https://twitter.com/ReactTraining/status/1716822590533353817
  - 1. Start by giving inputs names
  - 2. Use `new FormData` on the `event.target` . 
  - 3. Use `.get` to access fields by name.

- ## Unpopular opinion: Don't use http verbs PUT, PATCH, DELETE. Just use POST for everything. Reasons:
- https://twitter.com/matthewcp/status/1716549522015310116
  - `<form>` doesn't support the others. Frameworks that allow it do so through hacks.
  - URLs are free, you don't gain anything by overloading them.
  - Purity < practicality
- A bunch of infra-adjacent stuff is easier if you use proper verbs. Eg. PATCH is idempotent, POST is not.
  - *PUT is idempotent, PATCH is not necessarily. (According to MDN)
  - This is good in theory but broken in modern practice. E.g. Next.js caches POST requests, probably because GraphQL uses them even for reads without side-effects.
  - I used to make this argument, but now I think it's over-rated and I agree with the OP. It's just too hard to make every form do the right thing with respect to updates vs. creates. Also, it's rare that retrying an update is really what you want.
- Simplicity that works >>>> anything else.

- ## 使用fetch()上传formData数据时，千万不要在headers中设定content-type！
- https://twitter.com/ahshengchen/status/1687377120459378688

- multipart/form-data 如果修改了content type会覆盖解析数据需要的boundary。标准server就解析不到数据了，可以用postman or paw之类的查看一下和application/x-www-form-urlencoded的报文区别。

- 可以 postman 里测好了，用他的代码生成代码

- ## Apparently "email" and "number" inputs don't support setting a selection programmatically? That's a very very weird limitation
- https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1723356899037298691
  - "use the platform" should really be "use the good parts of the platform", not everything that's built into the browser is good, or even passable. 
  - And accidentally using a buggy part of a browser is a pretty important issue, because those the bugs that you basically can't fix.
- That was actually multiple times a reason for me to use text inputs instead of number inputs.

- ## Using the JavaScript `FormData` Web API, you can progressively enhance a simple, accessible form, into a more dynamic form, without the downsides of heavy JS frameworks that do the same thing.
