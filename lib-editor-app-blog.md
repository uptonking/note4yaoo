# guide
- tldr: Unless browsers will open for the Web multiple crucial features (such as IME, keyboard, selection, touch, on-screen keyboard, spellchecker, etc.) contentEditable is the only sane way to handle text editing.

- contenteditable gives you one very important feature that you can't fake yourself: access to the browser's spell check and corrections
- Yep, we do use contentEditable as an input source and also as the view to which we render (you wouldn't be able to reliably handle the keyboard otherwise).

## [ContentEditable  —  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_201508](https://ckeditor.com/blog/ContentEditable-The-Good-the-Bad-and-the-Ugly/)

- ### ContentEditable is evil and the Selection API is its evil twin. Avoid them as much as possible. 
- You need a custom selection system. 
  - It must be doable nowadays to get position (represented by a range, but we’ll simplify this in a moment) in the DOM on mousedown/mousemove. 
  - You’ll display your custom caret (whoa… you can control its style now) and text selection (it’s a simple ).
- You need to handle typing. 
  - Let’s listen to the keyboard events and insert given character into the editor.
- You need to handle navigation using the Arrow keys. 
  - Left and right seem easy, up and down a bit trickier but if you have point 1, you’ll do this too. 
  - Wait, there’s the Alt modifier which makes the Left and Right Arrow keys jump entire words. 
  - But of course you’ll look for spaces in the text and that’s it — told you, it’s trivial!
- Then you need to do something with pasting. 
  - You see that with the Clipboard API you can listen to the paste event on the document and retrieve the data from the data transfer. 
  - You can also use the old paste bin mechanism.

- ### ContentEditable — the Good Parts
- It’s amazing that adding one attribute to an HTML element enables typing, selection, keyboard navigation, spell checking, drag and drop, pasting, undo manager. 
  - That all of this is integrated with the OS, 
  - that such editor can be used with a screen reader or on a touchscreen device 
  - and that it’s well internationalised. 

- ### CKEditor
- Over the past years, while working on CKEditor I noticed that we were gradually replacing native features with our own implementations. 
- Since version 4.0, CKEditor has its custom “insert HTML into selection” mechanism and a feature allowing reaching non-editable places.
- CKEditor 4.1 introduced highly customisable content filtering (no more mess on paste). 
- CKEditor 4.3 brought support for non-editable islands with editable islands inside which required overriding many native systems (selection, keyboard, focus, clipboard).
- Finally, just a few weeks ago we made a final takeover of the clipboard, which means that in some browsers copy, cut and paste operations are fully handled by CKEditor.
- It means that today CKEditor does not let the browser do anything to the content except handling typing, some deleting and that’s basically it. 
  - At the same time, it still uses the native selection system, keyboard navigation and other APIs such as those related to clipboard or focus management.

- With CKEditor 5 we are planning to conclude this process by letting the browser insert text only, but with CKEditor’s control.

## [在线协作软件的三个核心引擎](https://juejin.cn/post/7002595221103968293)

- 优秀的协作软件必然由三个核心引擎构建：渲染引擎，协同引擎以及数据引擎
- 渲染引擎
  - 富文本编辑器
  - 表格编辑器
  - ppt/mind-map：图形编辑器
  - bi：布局设计器 + 图标设计器
- 协同引擎
  - 即时性、一致性、健壮性
  - 协同引擎存在的目的，本质就是保持各个终端在展示同一个内容模型时，能够在单个操作消费到模型之后，模型保持一致
  - 阶段1 - 客户端发送操作，
    - 操作等待同步给Server(其他协作者) pendingCommmands
    - 操作同步给Server（其他协作者） sendingCommands
    - 操作已同步给Server（其他协作者） sentCommmands
  - 阶段2 - 客户端模型消费操作
    - 操作作用于Model之后，客户端的Model应当与服务端的Model保持一致
- 数据引擎
  - Word - openxml的设计
  - Etherpad - 采用字符串 Z:1>6b|5+6b$Welcome to Etherpad!
  - Google Docs Word - 采用一个commands集合的设计
  - Google Docs Spread - 设计比较像Excel，但是使用的protobuf
  - Notion - 很明显是结构化的属性数据，并且使用CRDT的冲突解决数据结构
- 在Startup阶段，找到对应领域的合适技术选型，选择做出你协作软件的MVP，当自研能够成为你的壁垒或者优势，再选择自研

- [Creating a Rich Text Editor using Rust and React_202204](https://fiberplane.dev/blog/creating-a-rich-text-editor-using-rust-and-react/)
  - We used to use Slate.js — a fine editor — but as we’re implementing our own rich text primitives for collaborative editing, we discovered the disconnect between our own primitives and Slate’s data model to be somewhat of a hindrance. So we got to thinking - what if we just built our own Rich Text Editor (RTE)?
  - From a very high-level perspective, a rich text editor is comprised of two components:
  - A data model and the core logic to operate on it.
  - A view that renders the state of said data model and that handles the user interactions.
