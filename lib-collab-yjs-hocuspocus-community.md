- ## tinybase: We need a CRDT sync layer, and the transport ecosystem to go with it. What should we ship? _202302
- https://x.com/jamespearce/status/1629516942401847297
- YJS is great, the transport ecosystem not so much ‚Äì would stay away from y-websocket, consider https://hocuspocus.dev
- Downside of YJS is building native Swift app..

- How about a plug-in api and then a separate integration package for each?
  - Yeah that would be the idea. (Also fits with the peerDep ‚Äútiny‚Äù philosophy). Can probably reuse the persister API too.
- If you do that, make sure you provider a performant version of version vectors with GC.

- Build an adapter API. Then build implementation libraries for yjs and automerge adapters. They shouldn‚Äôt be peer deps. People should install or write the adapter they want and provide it via configuration.

- ## [Y-redis: An alternative backend to y-websocket - Show - Yjs Community _202403](https://discuss.yjs.dev/t/y-redis-an-alternative-backend-to-y-websocket/2509)
  - I just released y-redis - an alternative backend for y-websocket that is easy to scale and doesn‚Äôt keep data in-memory. 
  - It shows how you can implement auth, and it enables you to setup your own auth. 
  - I‚Äôve made a lot of iterations on y-redis over the years. This is the first time I‚Äôm happy with my implementation.
  - Please note that there are other backends to y-websocket, that probably provide better support (e.g. y-sweet).

- Is it possible to combine hocuspocus and y-redis? I have Hocuspocus instance and I want to improve my performance with y-redis. Is it possible?
  - Nope, it‚Äôs either one. But hocuspocus has a redis-extension as well 

- ## [address horizontal scalability in documentation _202304](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/issues/575)

- ## [Need Single Websocket Connection to open different docs _202212](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/issues/460)
- Right now Hocuspocus is developed in a way that it opens a new connection when you open a document. 
  - In our React SPA platform people regularly switching between documents. 
  - Now on changing on document the existing connection closes and a new connection is built. 
  - Which gives a feeling of a very slow document load. 
  - Because the Initial Connection Time, DNS Resolving, SSL Handshake etc takes approx 300-500 ms. 
  - Now if the documents can change within a single connection, all that time can give it a very fast impression.

- If this is added I would hope its optional.
  - Currently I am load balancing documents on the server across multiple hocuspocus instances each on its own process, each document is only ever open on one instance at a time.
  - If a user could change documents along their existing websocket connection that would break this as it would bypass the load balancer and allow them to force the document open on the wrong process.

- I've already played around here a bit, but figured that this requires some major rewrite of both the server and the client, as connections are tightly coupled with the document right now.

- ## [Use 1 WS connection to fetch documents instead of establishing connection for each documents _202205](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/issues/343)
  - Right now hocuspocus provider opens WS connection each time the document needs to change, instead, it should use one connection to handle document changes.
  - In addition to that, hocuspocus provider should have a plugin system like hocuspocus server where it should be possible to store documents in memory/browser's local storage or implement offline capabilities.
- ‚ú® [Release Multiplexing - now in v2.beta ¬∑ ueberdosis/hocuspocus _202303](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.0)
  - Multiplexing has been used in a few test projects now and is considered working. 

- ## [Redis Scaling _202108](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/issues/178)
  - In an ideal world you would be able to add the Redis extension, provide connection details for a redis instance or cluster and then spin up as many instances of the hocuspocus server as you like behind a loadbalancer. The Redis library would do all of the work of keeping documents in sync between instances.

- The other issue for my usage of Yjs/Hocuspocus at least is that my documents are large and the server is stateful. 
  - currently stopping me from running multiple workers of hocuspocus to take advantage of all my server's cores, as I can't afford to have every document be in memory multiple times.

- [Horizontal scalability approach _202107](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/discussions/133)
- We‚Äôre waiting for a y-redis rewrite from Kevin, and will start tackling that then. The HA setup we aim for is multiple hocuspocus nodes in the front with a hocuspocs worker (e.g. for Webhooks) in the background.

- ## [scaling hocuspocus _202104](https://github.com/ueberdosis/hocuspocus/issues/87)
- There were a few questions already about how to scale hocuspocus. The Redis extension is a start, but we still need to figure a lot of things out. In my opinion, this is how it should be done at the moment:
  - Have a load balancer as entrypoint
  - Have multiple nodes with hocuspocus running only the Redis extension behind the load balancer - Let's call them "workers"
  - Have a single node with hocuspocus running the Redis extension, RocksDB extension and any application integrations like the onConnect hook or the webhook extension. This node is not connected to the load balancer - Let's call it "manager"
- This way, all incoming traffic is split equally between the workers.

- I‚Äôm working on that thing, but I‚Äôm closing the issue here as it‚Äôs too broad. Feel free to follow up with questions though.

- ## üÜö anyone have opinions on yjs backends? liveblocks vs hocuspocus? _202407
- https://x.com/scottonote/status/1816646954786435107

- PartyKit is very easy to prototype with but still barebones (might improve over time. It‚Äôs the best option if you want flexibility with what you do in your websockets server and access to the larger Cloudflare ecosystem might be worth it too. But it‚Äôs not a purpose built Yjs backend.
  - For that, Liveblocks is the best, but there‚Äôs some initial setup. The setup is worth it though and everything is very well documented. They have APIs for a lot of stuff ‚Äì both client and server side ‚Äì as well as browser dev tools. 
- There‚Äôs also TipTap Collab which is a hosted version of Hocuspocus. The pricing is similar to Liveblocks but they bill by simultaneous connections instead of monthly active users, which is harder to estimate. 
- Both Hocuspocus and TipTap Collab however is not known for having good DX. Their docs however are a little less well written than Liveblocks and support from TipTap team tends to be patchy
  - With TipTap the way to debug is read the open source code yourself, fork the package and patch it, and submit a PR hoping it would be merged (won‚Äôt be in months), whereas Liveblocks is more of a managed service with support and DevRel.

- If you want full control, Partyserver / Partykit on Cloudflare is my pick
  - If you want a simplified, vendor solution then Liveblocks is absolutely great.

- Hocuspocus is super easy to self host. Liveblocks is great if you want an out of the box UX.

- Y-Sweet is built to be easy to use and self-host. There's a docker compose file that can be easily adapted to provide HTTPS. At scale you can also run on your own Cloudflare account (and soon on Jamsocket, too).

- ## how was your experience running the tiptap pro history extension w/ a self-hosted hocuspocus? 
- https://x.com/radian614/status/1879288472110055510
  - looking at your sync-server it doesn't seem like anything required patching on that end, just wondering if there were any quirks, esp with comments you ran into

- great, we had basically no issues with it. scales well too. the only gotcha was tracking schema versions so that if there's a change, the highest schema version wins and gets stored in the db. when we detect an old version, we flash a banner to reload and make the editor readonly.
  - https://github.com/campsite/campsite/blob/main/apps/web/components/Post/Notes/useEditorSync.ts#L66

- we rolled our own y.doc versions extension, but we don't store schema versions atm, prob should start doing that - thanks for the tip.
  - as a sidenote, is the styled-text-server it's own standalone thing for separation of concerns/unrelated translations? we've been using the hocuspocus openDirectConnection method to live translate and render html <> json <> yjs docs
