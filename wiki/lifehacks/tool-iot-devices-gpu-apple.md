- ## [Will apple make a macbook pro with an ultra chip? : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1o8ax0f/will_apple_make_a_macbook_pro_with_an_ultra_chip/)
  - Just imagine 1 tb of ram on a m5 or m6 ultra MacBook Pro? The price will be absurd and the battery will be short? Maybe they will restrict the ram, since it will use more power? 
- It's well known for people that work with computing hardware that RAM requires a lot of power and consumption grows as RAM increases. 
  - The issue is that data in RAM has a short life and has to be refreshed regularly or it gets corrupted/disappears. That's why laptops are always RAM constrained and desktops are not. 
  - There's more to it about scale and speed that requires workstation class machines to get to have extremely large RAM.
