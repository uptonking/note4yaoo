  - atlaskit editor

- Webpack Incremental Builds
  - Use webpack's watch mode. Don't use other tools to watch your files and invoke webpack. 
  - The built-in watch mode will keep track of timestamps and passes this information to the compilation for cache invalidation.
  - In some setups, watching falls back to polling mode. 
    - With many watched files, this can cause a lot of CPU load. 
    - In these cases, you can increase the polling interval with watchOptions.poll.
  - 可实现类似ts project references的快速增量编译
  - The following utilities improve performance by compiling and serving assets in memory rather than writing to disk:
    - webpack-dev-server/webpack-hot-middleware/webpack-dev-middleware

- [How Webpack decides what entry to load from a package.json](https://www.jonathancreamer.com/how-webpack-decides-what-entry-to-load-from-a-package-json/)
  - If the `target` of your app is `web` or a few others (which is default). 
  - It will look first at the `browser` field, and if it doesn't exist, it'll look for the `module`, and lastly `main`.
  - 可查看源码 WebpackOptionsDefaulter.js
  - if your Webpack target is `node`, it looks at the `module` and `main` for entry. Otherwise, it goes to the `browser`, then `module`, then `main`.
  - 技巧：module可指向源码，main指向转义后的es5代码

- [手写一个webpack，看看AST怎么用](https://juejin.cn/post/6930877602840182791)
  - webpack最基本的功能其实是将JS的高级模块化语句，import和require之类的转换为浏览器能认识的普通函数调用语句。
  - 要进行语言代码的转换，我们需要对代码进行解析。常用的解析手段是AST，也就是将代码转换为抽象语法树。
  - AST是一个描述代码结构的树形数据结构，代码可以转换为AST，AST也可以转换为代码。
  - babel可以将代码转换为AST，但是webpack官方并没有使用babel，而是基于acorn自己实现了一个JavascriptParser。

  - tapable的源码的抽象程度比较高，直接扎进去反而会让人云里雾里的，所以本文会从最简单的SyncHook和发布订阅模式入手
  - tapable的各种Hook其实都是基于发布订阅模式。
- [webpack核心模块tapable用法解析 - 掘金](https://juejin.cn/post/6939794845053485093)
  - webpack plugin高度依赖tapable这个库
  - tapable并没有具体的业务逻辑，是一个专门用来实现事件订阅或者他自己称为hook(钩子)的工具库，其根本原理还是发布订阅模式，但是他实现了多种形式的发布订阅模式，还包含了多种形式的流程控制。
  - 这些Hook主要有同步(Sync)和异步(Async)两种，同时还提供了阻断(Bail)，瀑布(Waterfall)，循环(Loop)等流程控制，对于异步流程还提供了并行(Parallel)和串行(Series)两种控制方式。
  - tapable其核心原理还是事件的发布订阅模式，他使用tap来注册事件，使用call来触发事件。

# webpack-config

# webpack-dev-server

- webpack
  - https://github.com/webpack/webpack
  - a module bundler
  - it bundles various module formats primarily so they can be run in a browser. 
  - It offers both a CLI and Node API.

- webpack-dev-server
  - https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server
  - 命令行会执行 `bin/webpack-dev-server.js` 的startDevServer()方法
  - Webpack Dev Server is itself an express server which uses `webpack-dev-middleware` to serve the latest bundle and additionally handles hot module replacement (HMR) requests for live module updates in the client.

- webpack-dev-middleware
  - https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware
  - Webpack Dev Middleware is middleware which can be mounted in an express server to serve the latest compilation of your bundle during development. 
  - This uses webpack's Node API in watch mode and instead of outputting to the file system it outputs to memory.
  - For comparison, you might use something like express.static instead of this middleware in production.
  - webpack-dev-middleware is a wrapper that will emit files processed by webpack to a server. 
  - This is used in webpack-dev-server internally, however it's available as a separate package to allow more custom setups if desired.
  - No files are written to disk, rather it handles files in memory
  - If files changed in watch mode, the middleware delays requests until compiling has completed

- webpack-hot-middleware
  - https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware
  - Actually making your application capable of using hot reloading to make seamless changes is out of scope, and usually handled by another library. 
  - This allows you to add hot reloading into an existing server without webpack-dev-server.
  - This module is only concerned with the mechanisms to connect a browser client to a webpack server & receive updates. 
  - It will subscribe to changes from the server and execute those changes using webpack's HMR API.
  - Actually making your application capable of using hot reloading to make seamless changes is out of scope, and usually handled by another library. 

- webpack-hot-server-middleware
  - https://github.com/60frames/webpack-hot-server-middleware
  - designed to be used alongside webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware to handle hot module replacement of server rendered apps.

- koa-webpack
  - https://github.com/shellscape/koa-webpack
  - Development and Hot Module Reload Middleware for Koa2, in a single middleware module.
  - This module wraps and composes webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-client into a single middleware module, allowing for quick and concise implementation.
  - it'll also use the installed webpack module from your project, and the webpack.config.js file in the root of your project
  - 作者会等webpack 5稳定后才会升级到webpack 5
  - webpack-dev-server基于express，非常受欢迎
  - 还要考虑是否支持框架层的插件，如react-fast-refresh
# webpack-extensions
- https://github.com/etsy/kevin-middleware
  - Kevin is an Express-style middleware that makes developing with Webpack in a monorepo a lot simpler. 
  - It's loosely based off of Webpack's dev middleware, and it is intended to be used as a replacement for it.
  - Using Webpack in development in a monorepo can be challenging because, by default, it will try to keep your entire JavaScript codebase in memory.
    - Kevin addresses this problem by allowing you to create separate Webpack configs for different parts of your codebase; 
    - it then manages these configs by having Webpack only watch and build relevant files.

- https://github.com/godaddy/radpack /js
  - Radpack fuses the best of both worlds by taking advantage of build-time bundling, with graph-based run-time loading to prevent wasteful waterfalls.

  - We use yarn workspaces, and whats known as a mono-repo. 
  - Essentially our entire codebase is in one git repo, divided into npm packages that all resolve in a single filesystem. 
  - In the past developers had to compile the entire codebase when changes were made. 
  - We created our own webpack plugin that detects which files have changed and only recompile the bundles specific to what has changed. 
  - Our plugin is a lot like the Hard Source plugin, which you can use to do the same thing. 
  - By detecting what has changed, and only recompiling the changed files, we cut many of our builds from 7+ minutes to 30 seconds.

- ## Do you know webpack can't guarantee the order of CSS chunks? 
- https://twitter.com/rspack_dev/status/1722493364774568218
  - Therefore, it's unwise to rely on the order of CSS chunks if your CSS depends on cross-module orders. 

- ## You either die a startup, or scale enough to return to webpack.
- https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy/status/1729761667204915238
- What are some features only possible in webpack?
  - In webpack and rspack, it’s language agnostic. It compiles to any target. Its optimization phase produce’s smaller artifacts than others, except for closure compiler. Chunk and bundle split is most accurate and adaptable. You have a runtime to manage module loading, and allow you to orchestrate and interact with it. Hmr works consistently. It can cache builds. You can build things like build doctor

- ## Surprisingly it is the persistent cache, fast prebundle of esbuild and the lazy compilation brought by esm that make Vite perform quickly, while the bundleless brought by esm actually slows down Vite. 
- https://twitter.com/hardfist_1/status/1729677009989587120
  - lazy compilation, persistent cache and fast bundle are the key, not bundleless.

- ## Do you know webpack supports skipping the parsing of large files through the use of the `module.noParse` option?
- https://twitter.com/rspack_dev/status/1719707638496125128

- ## 💡 That's actually the reason why @rspack_dev and Turbopack both give up Native ESM(bundleless), _20231128
- https://twitter.com/rspack_dev/status/1729435649177235539
  - It's not only bad for production scenarios but also bad for development scenarios.
- [Bundling vs Native ESM - Why Turbopack? – Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/why-turbopack#bundling-vs-native-esm)
  - Frameworks like Vite use a technique where they don’t bundle application source code in development mode. Instead, they rely on the browser’s native ES Modules system. This approach results in incredibly responsive updates since they only have to transform a single file.
  - We experimented with this approach, but ran into scaling issues with large applications made up of many modules. 
  - A flood of cascading network requests in the browser lead to a relatively slow startup time. 
  - For the browser, it’s faster if it can receive the code it needs in as few network requests as possible - even on a local server.
  - That’s why we decided that, like webpack, we wanted Turbopack to bundle the code in the development server.

- I really really wanted bundleless to work. Such an attractively simple solution! We built @nextjs Live in part to test out this hypothesis. Everything was “browser native”, from ESM to the the runtime (WinterCG). Then we tested it with Vercel’s homepage. 30s+ load times.
  - We even tried to “bundle the bundleless” as a tarball and do the unpacking in the browser to eliminate waterfalls. Still slow because it has to pack all the files. If we instead discover dependencies and pack them only… we’re back to bundling

- https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1730229238513520933
  - Glad Parcel stayed on the bundling train this whole time. Seems like the lessons we learned 10 years ago with require.js are finally being re-learned.
  - Another problem with native ESM is that it doesn’t tree-shake, so if you import a single thing from a module with a lot of exports (eg large component library), you could be downloading hundreds or thousands of unnecessary files. Recently made a tiny Vite test app which took 12 seconds to load in development due to that.
