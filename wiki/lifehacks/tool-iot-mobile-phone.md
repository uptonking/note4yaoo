- ## Is there a way to prevent android apps from disabling screenshots? 
- https://twitter.com/NicoloRibaudo/status/1781262203728925129
  - It's my phone, those pixels are being rendered on my display, I want to screenshot them.
- Unfortunately the only way to do it is with root. Some apps let you enable screenshots for a short period of time. I completely agree there should at least be a developer option for those of us who want full control.
- 2 mirrors and the camera app
- root the device and then im pretty sure magisk or something similar will let you bypass that.
- You'll need to root, install the Xposed framework and add this module: `Disable-FLAG_SECURE`.
- AFAIK, there isn't. This was made to avoid taking a screenshot of sensitive data as bank information.
