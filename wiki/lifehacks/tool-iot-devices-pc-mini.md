- The 780m will NOT do most games med-high settings 1080p 50-60fps, it will run older games fine and emulators fine but mid high in 2020 and newer games come on

- I just received my GMKtec Evo-X1 which I paid 800 before tax. Haven’t done extensive testing yet but it’s performing much better than my Z1E Ally.

- Budget wise you'll be far better off getting a used desktop rig. Older gen desktop GPUs will beat the pants off integrated GPU for less money You could try a mini with an egpu
