# Android OS
- Android确实是Linux的一个发行版，Android基于Linux而非GNU/Linux
  - Debian、Ubuntu基于GNU/Linux，它的应用层用的是GNU（glibc，libstdc++、GNU CoreUtils 等等），内核用的是Linux。
  - 而Android的应用层是自己的一套。
- 安卓基于Linux，在改版的Linux kernel上运行了一个改版的JAVA虚拟机，即ART（以前是Dalvik）。
  - 安卓也没有用GNU/Linux的套件，甚至这个kernel都是变种的。
- GNU计划始于1984年，它的最终的目标是完成一套完全自由的操作系统。
  - 到1991年，Linux内核的第一个版本公开发行时，GNU计划已经完成了除操作系统内核之外的大部分软件，
  - 其中包括了Shell程序（Bash），C语言程序库（Glibc）以及一个C语言编译器（GCC）等等。
  - 1992年Linus Torvalds开发了Linux - 一个免费的内核, 将Linux与几乎完成的GNU系统的结合诞生了一个完全的操作系统：一个基于Linux的GNU系统

- ## [What is the best photo editing app for android? : androidapps](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/x4nuzo/what_is_the_best_photo_editing_app_for_android/)
- According to me, the best one is krita, but only available and optimized for tablets. If you're even slightly familiar with Photoshop, Krita will not need a large learning curve. You might miss some of the AI features like subject selection etc, but you hall all the tools to do them manually. 
  - If you're on a phone, photo editor by dev. MacGyver is a pretty good free app. Otherwise, Snapseed is free & great, Lightroom is amazing and has most of its features available in the free version, VSCO is pretty good.

- ## [Besides Photoshop Express do you know of any other Android photo editing apps that will save 64MP shots from the V60 in their original resolution? (Includes howto for posting large images in the sub) : LGV60](https://www.reddit.com/r/LGV60/comments/qdd95e/besides_photoshop_express_do_you_know_of_any/)
- For photo editing on your phone, Snapseed is tough to beat. If you have a Windows PC, an open source program called GIMP is amazing, 100% legal and free. It even supports Adobe PS plug-ins, filters and add-ons.

- ## [Best site to get moded apks from : moddedandroidapps_202201](https://www.reddit.com/r/moddedandroidapps/comments/s9ogf5/best_site_to_get_moded_apks_from/)

  - if you only download plugins from betterdiscord's official website you wont get banned for using it, discord wont even know that you use betterdiscord. (been using betterdiscord since 2017)

- ## [Which daily use modded apps do you use? : moddedandroidapps_202108](https://www.reddit.com/r/moddedandroidapps/comments/oxrz9g/which_daily_use_modded_apps_do_you_use/)
