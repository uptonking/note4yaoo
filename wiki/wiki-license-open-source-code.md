# license-tips
- pdf2image 能将pdf转换为image, 代码是MIT, 但依赖 GPL协议的poppler来执行转换
  - it is by design that pdf2image does not in any way or form, link directly to poppler. All it does is call an already existing CLI utility that comes pre-installed on most Linux installation.
  - It's okay because pdf2image is not built or distributed with Poppler none of the Python code is "contaminated" by the GPL license.
  - I'm reopening this since it's not clear to me if running pdf2image inside a docker container can still be considered as MIT compatible ??
    - The container is not considered anything as it is not code, but GPL code can "live" with MIT code in a container without any issue.

- [Using GPL Software in Commercial Application as 2 Separate Parts : r/opensource _202410](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ftm86q/using_gpl_software_in_commercial_application_as_2/)
- My understanding is this: If you create a Docker container based off some distro base image, there will be tons of GPL software inside of it besides ffmpeg. For which you will have to provide source for ALL of them. Do you really want to get into that?
  - If your commercial tool just calls the ffmpeg binary, it depends how closely they interact
  - Mere aggregations do NOT require your program to be put under GPL.
  - If you come to the conclusion that what you are doing is a mere aggregation, I would suggest that you create packages for the popular distros. 
  - If you really want to take the Docker route, consider releasing the Dockerfile only and have the users build the container themselves. But that might be less convenient compared to installing a package.
- If you run this yourself and only offer a service with it (SaaS), you are likely fine. GPLv2 and GPLv3 don't prohibit this (but I think AGPL does, for example).
  - If you distribute it, it's a different matter. If the GPL parts are an essential part of your product - i.e. they are required to run and/or the only offered piece of software to fullfil the specific feature - they become part of the whole legal construct and therefore "infect" the rest of your software.
- LGPL allows usage in binary form, as long as the binary can be replaced by the user (and as long as the source for that binary can be obtained). So basically: calling an executable is fine, loading a dynamically linked library is fine, static linking would not be fine (unless, I think, you let the user do the linking step, then it might also be fine).

## [Polyform Licenses](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/)

- SPDX支持
  - PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0
  - PolyForm-Small-Business-1.0.0

- PolyForm Project publishes a suite of standardized licenses:
  - PolyForm Noncommercial is a general noncommercial license for software.
  - PolyForm Perimeter permits uses other than those that compete with the software.
  - PolyForm Shield permits uses other than those that compete with the provider of the software.
  - PolyForm Strict removes permission to distribute copies and make changes, leaving only permission to use for noncommercial purposes.
  - PolyForm Internal Use permits use for internal business purposes.
  - PolyForm Small Business permits use by small businesses and other small organizations.
  - PolyForm Free Trial permits a free, time-limited trial.

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24583479
  - If anyone is interested in using a source-available license for their own code, the Polyform Project has a set of standardized, source-available licenses. 
  - PolyForm Shield would probably achieve the same result as the Timescale License

## 💰 [Fair-code](https://faircode.io/)

- Fair-code is not a software license. 
- It describes a software model where software:
  - is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody
  - has its source code openly available
  - can be extended by anybody in public and private communities
  - is commercially restricted by its authors

- The following existing licenses meet all the fair-code requirements and projects using any of them can use the "fair-code" term.
  - Commons Clause with any OSI approved open-source license
  - Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2)
  - Confluent Community License
  - Sustainable Use License

## non-commercial-faq

- [Open-source license to prevent commercial use](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/4875)
  - There is now a license specifically designed to create source-available software for non-commercial use, namely the Commons Clause License.
  - Redis Labs 正在放弃其 Commons Clause 许可，转而使用新的“available-source”许可证

- [Can I license my project with an open-source license but disallow commercial use?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/9805)
  - There are several licences that disallow commercial use of the software (or other intellectual property). 
  - Most notably CC BY-NC 3.0 
  - If you want to reduce commercial use one of the more effective ways is to choose very strict licence like AGPL 3.0 and dual licence it with a commercial licence.
  - you can prevent your Open Source project from getting included in a closed-source project (for example, by using a GPL license), and then offer a dual-license option for companies who don't want to release their own proprietary code as open source.

- The Artistic License, in its current version 2.0, is a permissive open-source license with no copyleft similar to the MIT license.
- The main difference between the MIT license and the Artistic License is that the latter requires that any modification made to the code must be clearly stated.
- This license is almost exclusively used in the Perl community.
- The current Artistic License 2.0 is compatible with GPL: you can mix Artistic-Licensed code into GPL software.

- GPL规定：只要这种修改文本在整体上或者其某个部分来源于遵循GPL的程序，该修改文本的 整体就必须按照GPL流通，不仅该修改文本的源码必须向社会公开，而且对于这种修改文本的流通不准许附加修改者自己作出的限制。因此，一项遵循GPL流通的程序不能同非自由的软件合并。
- 任何一套软件，只要其中使用了受GPL协议保护的第三方软件的源程序，并向非开发人员发布时，软件本身也就自动成为受GPL保护并且约束的实体。也就是说，此时它必须开放源代码。
- 你可以去掉所有原作的版权信息，只要你保持开源，并且随源代码、二进制版附上GPL的许可证就行
- 无论软件以何种形式发布，都必须同时附上源代码。例如在Web上提供下载，就必须在二进制版本下载的同一个页面提供源码下载，如果以光盘形式发布，就必须同时附上源码
- 开发或维护遵循GPL协议开发的软件的公司或个人，可以对使用者收取一定的服务费用
- GPL只是规定用户在获取你的程序的时候必须可以获得源代码，但并没有规定必须免费
- 如果你的确需要发布你的程序，但又不想开源，规避GPL的方法是通过LPC或者RPC间接调用库里的接口。只要库和你的程序不运行在同一进程下，就不需要开源

- This license is mainly applied to libraries. 
  - You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are described and licensed for free under LGPL. 
  - Derivatives works (including modifications or anything statically linked to the library) can only be redistributed under LGPL, 
  - but applications that use the library don't have to be.

  - 要求 公开源码、库引用、协议和版权信息
  - 允许 商用、分发、修改、专利授权、私用、附加协议
  - 禁止 责任承担
- LGPL是GPL的一个为主要为类库使用设计的开源协议
- LGPL允许商业软件通过类库引用(link)方式使用LGPL类库而不需要开源商业软件的代码。这使得采用LGPL协议的开源代码可以被商业软件作为类库引用并发布和销售。
- 如果修改LGPL协议的代码或者衍生，则所有修改的代码，涉及修改部分的额外代码和衍生的代码都必须采用LGPL协议。因此LGPL协议的开源代码很适合作为第三方类库被商业软件引用，但不适合希望以LGPL协议代码为基础，通过修改和衍生的方式做二次开发的商业软件采用。
- 采用LGPL的代码，一般情况下它本身就是一个第三方库，这时候开发人员仅仅用到了它的功能，而没有对库本身进行任何修改，那么开发人员也不必公布自己的商业源代码。但是如果你修改了这个库的代码，那么你修改的代码必须全部开源，并且协议也是LGPL，但除了库源码之外的商业代码，仍不必公布

- ## [The LGPL License - FOSSA](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-lgpl-license/)
- As a copyleft license, LGPL requires users to release the source code of any changes to the original software
  - However, this requirement applies to a narrower set of code than the “regular” GPL.
  - A strong copyleft license (GPL v3, for instance) applies to the entire software program, including linked libraries and other components.
  - If you were to modify that LGPL-library and distribute it, then you’d have to release the changes. 
  - But **if your program simply uses the LGPL-library, there’s no need to share your source code for your part of the program** . 
  - You could even make your part of the program proprietary if you wanted to.
- The LGPL has different requirements depending on how the library is integrated with the remainder of the program. 
  - Generally, dynamic linking of LGPL code is considered best practice, as static linking makes meeting the license requirements more complicated. 
  - While it is possible to comply with LGPL code that is integrated into proprietary code as a statically linked library, it requires more effort. 
  - There is a kind of safe harbor for using LGPL code as a dynamically linked library; 
  - **for statically linked libraries, a distributor must offer access to not only the library’s source code, but other information or materials necessary to rebuild the program** . 
  - However, many programming languages have no equivalent of static linking, so that makes the dynamic linking safe harbor extremely helpful and effective in LGPL compliance.
- Like GPL, LGPL imposes no conditions on using the code in software that’s sold commercially.

- **LGPL is slightly different from other weak copyleft licenses, like the Mozilla Public License or Eclipse Public License, due to its special safe harbor for dynamic linking integration** .

- The LGPL does not permit sublicensing of the code, nor does it allow contributors to be held liable for legal issues or damages.
  - Like the MPL and CDDL, the EPL allows for sublicensing. 

- ## [If LGPL 2.1 source code is in my project. Does the whole project need to be LGPL? Or just the class that call it? - Open Source Stack Exchange](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/15078/if-lgpl-2-1-source-code-is-in-my-project-does-the-whole-project-need-to-be-lgpl)
  - If you have copied the library code into your project folders primarily for convenience and you have not made any changes to that code, then your tool is just a user of the library and you only have to comply with a small part of the LGPL2.1 license. In essence, your tool can have any license you like, but you must give the recipients of the tool the right and ability to replace the LGPL library with a different version.
  - If you have take portions of the library and built (some of) your tools out of them, then your code is a modification of the library and the full LGPLv2.1 license applies to you. This means that you must license your code also under the LGPLv2.1 license.

- ## [Does compiling a JS bundle with webpack/browserify violate the LGPL license?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/5139/does-compiling-a-js-bundle-with-webpack-browserify-violate-the-lgpl-license)
  - In the case of Javascript, source code has to be understood as the source on which the programmer will make modifications, i.e. the non-minified source.
  - The compilation process is not going to produce a binary but a minified version of the code that should be considered "object code".
  - Thus, you can respect the terms of the license by releasing "object code" (the minified version) of the work using the library without the library itself. You could just put a link somewhere in your application so that users can download it.

- ## [Want to use LGPL licensed library, do I need to change license or configure linker in some way?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/fevz37/want_to_use_lgpl_licensed_library_do_i_need_to/)
  - The LGPL does not forbid static linking, this is a common misconception. 
  - The LGPL doesn't need your project to be licensed under LGPL, nor does it require dynamic linking. 
  - All it requires you to do is to give abilities to modify the LGPL bits if they wish to (also, if you modify the LGPL bits you need to make your changes available under the LGPL) - that doesn't mean just giving people access to the LGPL source code, it means giving people the ability to run your application with arbitrary modified versions of the LGPL code. 
  - The easiest way to satisfy that requirement is via dynamic linking, but it's not the only one. 
  - If you give people access to the source code and the right to modify it (which you're normally doing with MIT licensed projects) that is one way to satisfy that requirement
  - If your project wasn't open source you still wouldn't technically be forbidden from static linking, but you'd still have to make it possible to swap out the LGPL bits (for example, by providing object files of your project), although this is getting into territories where it is a bit tricky to comply so some commercial projects just straight up ban the use of LGPL licensed code.
  - 👉🏻 The intent of the license is that a user should be able to substitute the library for their version
    - There are some possible approaches.
    - You can dynamically link the library. 
    - You can provide a separate dynamically linked library that wraps over an LGPL licensed crate with C compatible API and load it with a library like libloading.
    - You can provide the source code of your program. It doesn't have to be free software. 

- [LGPL protected file](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2642)
  - LGPL is suitable for a "dynamically-linked" file, but NOT for a "statically-linked" file. What do those terms mean in a JS context?
  - Using webpack, minify, etc to aggregate a JS/TS project (as is standard practice), makes the project into a "statically-linked" monolith - which makes the entire work into an GPL-derivative work. 

- [LGPL license in a concatenated JS file - Open Source Stack Exchange](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/8063/lgpl-license-in-a-concatenated-js-file)
  - LGPL goes only for the code it's licensed under and for modifications of said code.
  - If the LGPL code would be in a separate file, then you would only open source that file under LGPL.

- ## [LGPL is more business friendly than GPL; it's literally "lesser" GPL.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35461088)
  - You can use LGPL in commercial, closed-source projects as long as you keep the LGPL code in a separate dynamically linked library, e.g. a DLL, and provide a way for users to swap it out for their own patched DLL if they wish. (Plus some other license terms.)
  - Also, you can always use LGPL code under the terms of the GPL, so there's no way LGPL is more restrictive than GPL.
  - Beware that you may need to be careful using LGPL code in a browser: JavaScript is source code not object code, arguing WASM is a DLL wouldn’t help, **most JavaScript minifiers perform static linking** , and sending LGPL code to the browser could be considered distribution. I always avoided all LGPL licensed libraries when doing commercial front-end work.

- [MPL 2.0 FAQ — Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/)
  - The MPL's "file-level" copyleft is designed to encourage contributors to share modifications they make to your code, while still allowing them to combine your code with code under other licenses (open or proprietary) with minimal restrictions.

- Is "minified" JavaScript Source Code?
  - No. Minified JavaScript, while not an "executable" in the software engineering sense of the word, is difficult for humans to read, edit, and modify. so it is not Source Code as defined by the license.
  - Therefore, minified JavaScript is the Executable form, and the responsibilities set out in the license for distribution of the Executable form should be met when you distribute minified MPL-licensed JavaScript.
  - This means, among other things, that you do not need to, and probably should not preserve the MPL boilerplate (which begins "This Source Code Form...") when minifying JavaScript. However, you do need to comply with section 3.2(a) by informing the recipients of the minified source how they can obtain a copy of the source code. 
  - 💡 Note that treating minified JavaScript as an executable increases distributor flexibility by allowing MPL-licensed code to be combined into a single file with non-MPL JavaScript source code without requiring the non-MPL code to be distributed under the terms of the MPL.

- ## [Could anyone explain the difference between LGPL and MPL to a non-dev? : r/opensource _202410](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1g2sprd/could_anyone_explain_the_difference_between_lgpl/)
- MPL-2.0 applies copyright on a per-file basis. Software that integrates with it only needs to open source modifications made to the MPL files under the same license.
- LGPL takes that a step further by requiring any code that depends on the LGPL library to open source itself with the same license up to the boundary of a dynamic link.
- GPL takes that a step further by declaring that any application process that dynamically links to GPL libraries must be provided under the GPL license.
- And AGPL takes that to the next step where any application process that interacts with an AGPL must be of the same license.

- If something is licensed under LGPL the end-user (not only the developer who used the LGPL code for their own work but also everyone they give their work to) must be able to replace the LGPL parts with alternatives.
  - MPL doesn't have the requirement that the end-user must be able to replace the already compiled code. So a png-loader under MPL would allow the programmer to directly include it in the same file and the end user couldn't replace it anymore.

- [Is MPL copyleft actually useful? : r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1istuay/is_mpl_copyleft_actually_useful/)
  - I like the MPL2 precisely because the boundaries are clear, and I'm not hassling anyone too much about using my code with their code. But, when they change my code, then they have to contribute back.

- ## [Mozilla Public License 2.0 - FOSSA](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-mozilla-public-license-2-0/)
- Weak copyleft licenses like the Mozilla Public License 2.0 also require users to disclose their changes to the source code, but requires sharing of a narrower set of code. 
  - If an author reworks any of the original files, they have to release those updates when distributing the code and license them under the MPL.
  - 👉🏻 However, **if the author keeps the MPL’d code in separate files, they can combine that code with closed-source code to create an aggregate work** . 
  - The new code files can be kept proprietary or released **under a different license** .
  - This is sometimes referred to as file-based copyleft.
- MPL 2.0 obligates users to state that the code is under the MPL license and share where they can find the license
- Sublicense binaries. **A developer may place binaries under a different license in the context of an aggregate work** .

- ### mpl vs lgpl
- Unlike the MPL, the LGPL does not allow users to sublicense the code. 
  - It also requires anyone who includes the code as part of a consumer device to include any installation information necessary to update and reinstall the software.

- ### mpl vs epl

- [What are some differences between MPLv2 and EPLv2?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/10860/what-are-some-differences-between-mplv2-and-eplv2)
  - The MPL is compatible with the GPL by default.
  - The EPL is not compatible with the GPL by default. 

- Both the MPL v2.0 and EPL v2.0 allow contributors to optionally release code either under the license by which it was originally released or under future published versions of the respective licenses. As far as I can tell, neither license implicitly upgrades to a future version

- These two licenses have a fair amount in common, including that both allow for aggregate works to be sublicensed. 
- One key difference is that the EPL offers additional legal protections to contributors.
  - Namely, any company that uses EPL’d code in commercial software must defend the code’s contributors should any lawsuits or damages arise regarding that software. Both licenses contain an explicit grant of patent rights.

- ## [How does the scope of the MPL's copyleft compare with the LGPL and GPL's copyleft?](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/)
- MPL: The copyleft applies to any files containing MPLed code.
- LGPL: The copyleft applies to any library based on LGPLed code.
- GPL: The copyleft applies to all software based on GPLed code.

- ## I want to use software which is available under the MPL. What do I have to do?
- Nothing. 
- Like all other free and open source software, software available under the MPL is available for anyone (including individuals and companies) to use for any purpose. 
- The **MPL only creates obligations for you if you want to distribute the software outside** your organization.

- ## I want to distribute (outside my organization) executable programs or libraries that I have compiled from someone else's unchanged MPL-licensed source code, either standalone or part of a larger work. 
- You must inform the recipients where they can get the source for the MPLed code in the executable program or library you are distributing (i.e., you must comply with Section 3.2). 
- You may distribute any executables you create under a license of your choosing, as long as that license does not interfere with the recipients' rights to the source under the terms of the MPL.

- ## I want to distribute (outside my organization) MPL-licensed source code that I have modified. 
- You must inform the recipients that the **source code is made available to them under the terms of the MPL** (Section 3.1), including any Modifications (as defined in Section 1.10) that you have created.
- You must respect the restrictions on removing or altering notices in the source code

- ## I want to distribute (outside my organization) an executable program based on MPL-licensed source code that I have modified. What do I have to do?
- You must **make available the MPL-licensed portions of the source code** as described in the previous question, and inform the recipients how they can obtain such source code

- ## If I use MPL-licensed code in my proprietary application, will I have to give all the source code away?
- No. The license requires that Modifications (as defined in Section 1.10 of the license) must be licensed under the MPL and made available to anyone to whom you distribute the Source Code. 
- However, new files containing no MPL-licensed code are not Modifications, and therefore do not need to be distributed under the terms of the MPL, even if you create a Larger Work (as defined in Section 1.7) by using, compiling, or distributing the non-MPL files together with MPL-licensed files. 
- This allows, for example, programs using MPL-licensed code to be statically linked to and distributed as part of a larger proprietary piece of software, which would not generally be possible under the terms of stronger copyleft licenses.

- This license, made and used by the Eclipse Foundation, is **similar to GPL** but allows you to link code under the license to proprietary applications. 
  - You may also license binaries under a proprietary license, as long as the source code is available under EPL.
- must include copyright/license/original, disclose source, compensate for damages

  - 1、EPL是弱copyleft的，也即“传染性”较弱，通常情况下，如果链接或调用EPL程序，并不构成传染；但如果你修改了EPL程序，分发时就要按EPL要求公开源码。
  - 2、EPL有个第二许可证，就是GPLv2及以后版本（本文简称GPL）。在满足一定条件下，EPL程序可以按照GPL发布。

- ## [The Eclipse Public License - FOSSA](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-eclipse-public-license/)
- As a weak copyleft license, the EPL is a middle ground of sorts between permissive options (like the MIT License or Apache License 2.0) and strong copyleft licenses (like GPL v2 and GPL v3.)
- A core requirement of the EPL — one that’s not part of permissive licenses — is that derivative works of EPL-licensed code must also be licensed under the EPL. 
  - (As such, anyone who distributes a program that constitutes such a derivative work must also make their source code available.)
- 👉🏻 However, the EPL’s definition for a derivative work is narrower than GPL’s.
  - **Under the EPL, if you simply use — rather than modify — an EPL-licensed component and keep it in a separate file, that would not constitute a derivative work, and you would not be required to make available your source code** . 
  - With the GPLs, however, any use (modified or not) of the licensed code would create a derivative work.
- Users can rework the code, but if they distribute these modifications, they must release these updates in source code form.
- Users can add a Secondary License to enable compatibility with GPL v2 or later

- ### EPL vs MPLv2
- A notable difference between the two is that the the MPL 2.0 does not include the EPL’s legal protections for project contributors.

- Like the EPL, the Mozilla Public License 2.0 allows users to keep (unmodified) MPL’d code in a separate file, then combine that code with code under a different license to create an aggregate work. The new/additional files can be released under a different license.

- ### epl vs lgpl
- A notable difference between the LGPL and other weak copyleft licenses is that the LGPL does not allow users to sublicense binaries under other terms, while the EPL and MPL 2.0 do.

- ## What are the major changes between EPL-1.0 and EPL-2.0?
- The term of art is now referred to as "file" rather than "module"; 
- The choice of law provisions has been removed; 
- The license is **now suitable for scripting languages such as JavaScript** ; and
- The license now includes an option to add a secondary license for GPL-2.0+ compatibility.

- ## [EPL-Licensed Library with Closed-Source Commercial Product](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/152983/epl-licensed-library-with-closed-source-commercial-product)
- EPLv1 is copyleft, because it requires you to release any changes you made to the EPL code while working on your main app. 
- **The difference from GPL is that it's a commercial-friendly copyleft, requiring you only to make those changes available and only if you distribute your commercial app** . 
  - **And if you made no changes, no source code to release** 

- You need to mention it includes EPL code, and allow them to request access to the source code of the EPL code if they want, including any modifications you've made to it. Your own code though, which only uses the EPL code in an import for example, does not need to be made EPL, and you do not have to give its source away

- ## Is my EPL-2.0 licensed project GPL compatible by default?
- No. EPL-2.0 licensed projects may explicitly add GPL compatibility by way of adding a Secondary License
# EUPL(European Union Public License) 欧盟花式协议, 类似AGPL但可LINK
- [FAQs | Interoperable Europe Portal ](https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/faqs)
- Closing the SaaS/ASP loophole
  - EUPL assimilates(吸收) "communication to the public" to "distribution" and therefore targets and covers SaaS (software as a service) and the ASP (application service provider) activity.
  - The EUPL covers not only the classical software distribution, but also the "communication to the public" through remote access, or the provision of SaaS (software as a service) through the Internet. On this specific point, the EUPL is like the AGPL.
- The EUPL is not viral(病毒性的): according to the provision of European Law (Directive EC 2009/24 recitals 10 & 15), static and dynamic linking can be implemented with other programs without barriers or conditions. On this specific point, le EUPL works like the LGPL. 
- The EUPL is a "software license" by design, but it covers "the Work" and what could be considered as its components or derivatives:  documentation, ancillary data or even hardware in case it includes the Work.

- [What are your thoughts on the EUPL licence? : r/opensource _202408](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1eht9p0/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_eupl_licence/)
- What's the difference with AGPLv3?
  - Probably "common law" vs "civil law" problem. AGPL has never been tested in court, but court decisions are central in common law systems. so we don't know how it would really go. EU is civil law-centric, so the license is kind of already approved by the government, result in court is pretty already known. In the end it's probably exactly the same, it's just that the philosophy of justice is different between Europe and US so they had to publish something official for their own use.

- The EUPL does NOT allow you to "relicense" (aka changing the license of the code without being the owner of said code). It DOES allow you to distribute a combined work under a different license.
  - When you have a EUPL licensed application and add a GPLv3-only licensed component to it, you CAN redistribute the whole (EUPL+GPL-3) under the GPL. BUT, all of the EUPL code stays EUPL. So as soon as a user comes to know that parts of the GPL product are EUPL licensed, they have the right to get that code under the EUPL.

- It is OK with static linking and incorporation of the code in contrast to GPLv3 for example.

- EUPL allows relicensing to a bunch of other licenses, which means it has rather weak copyleft. I think you're better off with a license that matches your intention, either (A)GPL for strong copyleft or MPL for mild copyleft.

- [EUPL: European Union Public License | Lobsters _202603](https://lobste.rs/s/msjuyz/eupl_european_union_public_license)
  - The EUPL as far as licenses go is an improvement over the MPL in my opinion, it provides the guaranteed of the LGPL without the downsides of GPL, it's versatile and protects you from hostile forks.
# CDDL
- ref
  - [The CDDL (Common Development and Distribution License) - FOSSA](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-cddl-common-development-distribution-license/)

- The CDDL has similar provisions to the Mozilla Public License 2.0 and the Eclipse Public License
- As a weak copyleft license, the CDDL carries more requirements on the use of the licensed code than permissive licenses but offers more freedoms than strong copyleft licenses.

- Users can rework the code, but if they distribute these modifications, they must make them available in source code form.

- CDDL vs. MPL
  - MPL 2.0 is compatible with GPL v2 or later, LGPL 2.1 or later, and/or AGPL 3.0 or later, while the CDDL and earlier versions of the MPL are not.

- EPL’s secondary license provision, which is not part of the CDDL
# AGPL (Affero General Public License)
- you have to allow the source to be downloaded even if you never distribute the binary but do provide a service
- GPL v2和v3还有一个非常大的“漏洞”，就是软件“发布” 才必须开源。
  - 如果软件不发布，即使使用GPL v2和v3也可以不用开源。
  - 随着以Google为代表的软件作为服务的互联网公司的兴起，它们的“不分发软件，为客户提供网络服务”的商业模式就不受GPL协议的约束
- AGPL = GPL + 一条限制
- 一条限制：如果使用AGPL许可的软件与用户通过网络进行交互，也需要提供源代码给用户，所有的修改也要给用户

- ## [The AGPL License - FOSSA](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-agpl-license/)
- The idea behind the AGPL License was to address the “application service provider (ASP) loophole(漏洞), ”
  - The AGPL License is based on GPL v3. It has the same requirements, plus the statement regarding remote access via a network.
  - Let’s say you create a software program. Another developer takes and modifies it, and then provides access to that modification to paying customers through a software-as-a-service model. 
  - Under the GPL v3, that modification would essentially become proprietary because it wasn’t technically distributed. 
  - Under AGPL, however, that developer would need to make their modified source code available for download.

- Users can change or rework the code, but if they distribute these changes/modifications in any public way (including over a server), they must release these updates in source code form under the AGPL license.
  - As long as these modifications are also released under the GNU AGPL, they can be distributed to others.

- The AGPL License does not permit sublicensing of the code; 
  - that is, you cannot rework or add to the code and then close those changes off to the public. 
  - The “open source-ness” of the original code follows any update or addition. 
  - Both GPL v2 and GPL v3 contain this provision as well.
# Server Side Public License (SSPL)
- [Server Side Public License FAQ](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq)
- [Server Side Public License (SSPL) | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license)

- ## Why did you base the SSPL on GPL v3 instead of AGPL?
  - The AGPL is a modified version of GPL v3. 
  - The only additional requirement of AGPL is in section 13: if you run a modified program on a server and let other users communicate with it there, you must open source the source code corresponding to your modified version, known as the “Remote Network Interaction” provision of AGPL.
  - 👉🏻 **There is some confusion in the marketplace about the trigger and scope of the Remote Network Interaction provision of AGPL** .
  - As a result, we decided to base the SSPL on GPL v3 and to add a new section 13 which clearly and explicitly sets forth the conditions to offering the licensed program as a third-party service.

- ## What specifically is the difference between the GPL and the SSPL?
  - The only substantive modification is section 13, which makes clear the condition to offering MongoDB as a service. 
  - A company that offers a publicly available MongoDB as a service must release the software it uses to offer such service under the terms of the SSPL, including the management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the source code made available.

- [graalvm license分析 _202009](https://mjblog.github.io/2020/09/25/graal_license/)
  - graalvm社区版本使整体是GPLv2 with classpath exception
  - 目前关心的组件主要有GPLv2(compiler/vm)、UPL(truffle/js)和BSD(sulong)三种协议
  - UPL是非常开放友好的开源协议。不仅允许任意重用代码(包括商业使用)，而且明确提供了专利授权和保护，法律风险非常低

- A highly permissive license **similar to the MIT** License 
  - with added features including an explicit patent grant, clear ability to relicense (to commercial, proprietary, copyleft or etc...) and usable as a CLA.  
  - It is compatible with most commercial and copyleft (GPL-family) licenses.

- The UPL is a highly permissive license, including both copyright and patent licenses, 
  - which permits use and relicensing under both copyleft and commercial terms, and also facilitates use as a contributor license agreement.
- The most important problem the UPL solves is the inclusion of an express patent license in a license 
  - that is both broadly agreed to be uniformly copyleft compatible and also permits the software to be freely used in commercially licensed software (i.e., without concerns about reciprocal license obligations).
  - The MIT and BSD licenses do not include express patent licenses
- Another problem solved with the UPL, is that licensors and distributors are expressly permitted to reference the UPL rather than including a complete copy of the text in each item. 
  - The MIT and BSD licenses expressly require that you include a complete copy of the license in each piece of source code. 
- Finally, the inclusion of the Larger Works concept facilitates use as a contributor license agreement (CLA), 
  - with contributors granting a patent license to the works to which they're contributing, 
  - and therefore creating a common & safe platform for collaboration where no one is going to assert infringement by the same project in which they're an active participant.

- [What is a Universal Permissive License?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Universal-Permissive-License)
  - A Universal Permissive License or UPL is used in software 
    - when you want to release it for free use most of the time you are given up all rights to the software that you developed. 
    - It can be modified to state something like your name must be included as the original developer of the software.

- [Guest View: Use Oracle’s UPL, abandon your intellectual property](https://sdtimes.com/guest-view-use-oracles-upl-abandon-intellectual-property/)
  - (201406)Recently, Oracle submitted the new Universal Permissive License (UPL) for approval to the Open Source Initiative (OSI), claiming the UPL filled the need for 
    - a permissive, MIT-style open-source license with explicit patent grants.
    - Oracle drafted the UPL to address concerns it had with proposed changes to the Java Community Process (JCP), specifically with regard to license rights in others’ reference implementation technology of Java specifications. 
    - Oracle expressed concerns with using other open-source licenses for reference implementation technology due to its need to license this technology under both proprietary licenses (with patent grants) and the GPLv2.
  - At a high level, the UPL copyright and patent licenses are overly broad. 
    - They extend to current and future versions of both the UPL-licensed code as well as any software or hardware identified in a file included with the UPL-licensed code.

  - For example, it does not allow hosting of Confluent ksqlDB, Confluent Schema Registry, Confluent REST Proxy, or other software licensed under the Confluent Community License as online service offerings that compete with Confluent SaaS products or services that provide the same software.  
  - If you are not doing what is excluded, this license change will not affect you.
# Cryptographic Autonomy License
- [Understanding the Cryptographic Autonomy License - Holochain Blog](https://blog.holochain.org/understanding-the-cryptographic-autonomy-license/)
  - Public Performance of Software? 类似歌曲的著作权、表演权
  - TL; DR; Copyleft + Performance
  - Holochain’s license boils down to this: You can run Holochain as free and open source software with a couple of conditions:
  - The source code of Holochain and **any derivative works must be provided under compatible open source terms** which include this condition and the following condition related to privacy of cryptographic keys.
  - You only have permission for “public performance” of Holochain (including use of its APIs for running your dApp) if you preserve each end-user’s privacy and autonomy of their private cryptographic keys.
  - If the privacy of user keys is compromised, then so is the ownership of their data, as well as user’s control of their own copies of the software.
  - I’ve never seen a software license invoke this kind of “public performance” clause, so it may stir up some controversy and make it challenging to get our license accepted by OpenSource.org; but it is the only way we’ve found to release Holochain with responsible protections for end-users.

- LibreOffice is distributed primarily under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0), but the codebase also contains components under other OSS licenses (LGPL/GPL, Apache, etc.). You can license your own app under MIT or Apache, but any LibreOffice source files you copy or modify remain governed by their original licenses (typically MPL-2.0) and you must comply with those terms.
  - MPL-2.0 = file-level (weak) copyleft. If you modify a file that is MPL-2.0, you must make that file’s source (with your modifications) available under MPL-2.0 when you distribute the product. Files you create that are separate may remain under MIT/Apache
  - Your Code: You can license your own .java, .cpp, .py, etc., files under MIT, Apache, or even a proprietary closed-source license.
  - LibreOffice Code: The LibreOffice files (and any modifications you make to them) must remain under the MPL 2.0.
