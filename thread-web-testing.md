- ## 

- ## Chrome can dynamically insert console.logs without touching your code.
- https://twitter.com/marvinhagemeist/status/1527356830757933058
  - Just right-click on the line and choose "logpoint", enter the variables you want to log and hit Enter
- ðŸ’¡ Pro-tip: instead of a logpoint for say `node` you can also use a conditional breakpoint with `console.trace(node)` as condition to achieve a logpoint that also includes the stack trace in the log message.

- ## Use npm pack to test your packages locally
- https://dev.to/scooperdev/use-npm-pack-to-test-your-packages-locally-486e
- First: Build your Package
  - Before you can use npm pack you must first build your package.
- Second: Locate your Build Artifacts package.json
  - The important part of this step is to run npm pack in the correct folder location where the build artifact package.json is located.
- Third: Pack you artifacts
  - npm pack --pack-destination ~
  - Now it is time to package our build artifacts to enable us to produce a package that mimic what would be published to npm. We tell npm to pack it to our user folder ~ for ease.
- Fourth: Point package.json to your file
  - "dependencies": {   "@ag-grid-community/angular": "file:~/ag-grid-community-angular-27.0.0.tgz" }
  - npm install
- Fifth: Test you package in your application

- ## One of the best ways a web developer can truly help make websites work the same in every browser is to help create more tests for WPT(Web Platform Tests). 
- https://twitter.com/TerribleMia/status/1431381473421049858
  - We all want interoperability. 
  - Testing is a way to get there, and not regress. 
  - But we need more tests written to check on more things.
- http://wpt.live has all the tests, live, in your browser
- http://wpt.fyi has a dashboard of the results in various browsers
