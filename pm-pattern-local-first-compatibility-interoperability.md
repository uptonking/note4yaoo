  - Data management, integration and modeling with blocks
  - The Block Protocol is an open-source standard and registry for sharing interactive blocks connected to structured data.
  - You can build your own blocks, embed them in a website, or allow your users to embed blocks directly within your application.
  - HASH is our forthcoming open-source, all-in-one workspace platform built around structured data and interactive blocks.

  - https://solidproject.org/about
  - Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. 
    - Pods are like secure personal web servers for your data.
    - To store and access data in your Pod, applications use standard, open, and interoperable data formats and protocols.
  - Solid Technical Reports (TR) of the W3C Solid Community Group (CG) to meet the needs of the Solid Project.
  - [Solid Protocol Spec Draft](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol)
  - Solid adds to existing Web standards to realise a space where individuals can maintain their autonomy, control their data and privacy, and choose applications and services to fulfil their needs.

  - Building protocols for the future of the Internet
  - Protocol Labs pioneered decentralized storage with the introduction of IPFS. 
  - Protocol Labs is an open-source R&D lab. We build protocols, tools, and services to radically improve the internet

- m-ld
  - https://m-ld.org/
  - With m-ld, information is available where it's used—on mobiles, in browsers, in microservices, anywhere—and it stays up-to-date, automatically. It's live and sharable.
  - At the heart of m-ld is a decentralised protocol for distributing live information among clones. 
  - Using m-ld, every instance of an app has read-write access to the shared information via its local clone, with zero network latency. 
    - Changes to the information are propagated to all other app instances, so they are all eventually consistent.
  - https://github.com/m-ld/m-ld-spec
    - m-ld is a decentralised live information sharing component with a JSON-based API.
