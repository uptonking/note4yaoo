- ## ü§ºüèª Created an RFC for @getwebstudio to stop using React custom hooks in the application logic.

  - Hooks are not pure functions, they can be effectful.
  - Custom hooks are too powerful. Using custom hooks for application level logic inevitably leads to bad code.
  - Custom hooks are good for libraries
  - The right way to make readable code in react and simplify your abstractions is to use components. By extracting the shared logic into a component, changing open state doesn't cause MyTextField rerender.

- Anyone returning markup from a custom hook deserves all the pain they get.
