  - User-friendly WebUI for LLMs (Formerly Ollama WebUI)
  - extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted WebUI designed to operate entirely offline. 
  - 后端tavily搜索部分用到了langchain，langchain整体仅7个文件
  - It supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs
  - 🌹 pros: comfyui
  - 🐛 cons: MCP
  - [Open WebUI changed license from BSD-3 to Open WebUI license with CLA | Hacker News _202505](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43901575)
    - What really is the moat of openwebui? I have seen at least 4 - 5 react UIs with similar functionality (chat, RAG, document library).
    - Not sure about the moat, it's mostly a SvelteKit web app with extra utils after all. But it has a rather unique combination of advanced features (RAG integrations, workspaces, pipelines, code execution, MCP integration, etc.) and a user-friendly "production grade" interface. 
    - They swapped out MIT for BSD-3 just five months ago

    - Any time you add or edit an MCP server, you will need to restart LibreChat to initialize the connections.
  - [Enhancement: Extend Stable Diffusion plugin to work with ComfyUI _202405](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/2672)
    - We already support Stable Diffusion. It will be great to add support for ComfyUI.
