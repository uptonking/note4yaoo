- ## 🆚 [System Prompt vs. User Prompt : r/LocalLLaMA _202504](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1k88k0h/system_prompt_vs_user_prompt/)
- System prompts tend to use some degree or form of Ghost Attention 
  - Having a system prompt that is generic but purposeful means it is easier to dump your content without user instruction bias
  - And finally, a reminder that the LLM gets a text blob and expands the text blob. The reason to do something isn't because of the 'format' the LLM gets. It's just the pattern recognition that matters, and that is not always the easiest to see without experimenting.

- The biggest one being in how attention is applied internally by the model, with system prompt receiving a lot more of it. So system prompt matter A LOT. But what's more is that if you want to get the most out of the system prompt, you want to combine the system prompt TOGETHER with the user message for maximum affect.

- i imagine it mostly depends on how the model was trained. as for your question regarding a specific model, probably the only way to properly answer the question is to test it yourself. theorycrafting here will only lead to assumptions.

- LLMs tend to focus more on messages in certain positions, with system messages getting the highest attention weight. This often leads to undesired results when users design multi-agent systems or perform real-time RAG in multi-turn conversations. We call this theory of varying attention weights based on message position "position bias."

  - "Step-Back Prompting" is an effective solution that leads to dramatic improvements.
  - The basic idea is simple: Instead of immediately solving a problem, first ask the model to identify what type of problem it's dealing with and which principles apply.

- Examples beat instructions 
  - Wasted weeks writing perfect instructions. Then tried 3-4 examples and got instant results. 
  - Models pattern-match better than they follow rules (except reasoning models like o1)
- Version control your prompts like code 
  - One word change broke our entire system. Now I git commit prompts, run regression tests, track performance metrics. Treat prompts as production code
- Test coverage matters more than prompt quality 
  - Built a test suite with 100+ edge cases. Found my "perfect" prompt failed 30% of the time. 
  - Now use automated evaluation with human-in-the-loop validation
- Domain expertise > prompt tricks 
  - Your medical AI needs doctors writing prompts, not engineers. 
  - Subject matter experts catch nuances that destroy generic prompts
- Temperature tuning is underrated 
  - Everyone obsesses over prompts. Meanwhile adjusting temperature from 0.7 to 0.3 fixed our consistency issues instantly
- Model-specific optimization required 
  - GPT-4o prompt ≠ Claude prompt ≠ Llama prompt. 
  - Each model has quirks. What makes GPT sing makes Claude hallucinate
- Chain-of-thought isn't always better 
  - Complex reasoning chains often perform worse than direct instructions. 
  - Start simple, add complexity only when metrics improve
- Use AI to write prompts for AI 
  - Meta but effective: Claude writes better Claude prompts than I do. Let models optimize their own instructions
- System prompts are your foundation 
  - 90% of issues come from weak system prompts. Nail this before touching user prompts
- Prompt injection defense from day one 
  - Every production prompt needs injection testing. One clever user input shouldn't break your entire system

- The biggest revelation: prompt engineering isn't about crafting perfect prompts. It's systems engineering that happens to use LLMs

- When I said prompt injection I meant more to when you are using AI inside your app and the user can talk to it (via a bot or smth similar). The two ways (as far as I know & tried) you can implement prompt injection defense are:
  - Giving very solid instruction inside your templated-prompt you are using for your LLM.
  - Fine tune your AI model to train it against prompt injections, but this a lot more time & resources, yet it's way more effective than any templated prompt.

- Examples are good, however small models will overuse them and they can really ruin the output so you have to be tactical where you use them.
  - I have a system in place that randomly picks examples from a larger set so you have more variety while keeping prompts lean.
- Nice! I’ve a number of workarounds, my favourite is using unrelated examples that the LLM would never actually use - so it copies the structure but uses the context for the actual content.

- Don’t make prompts static. Dynamically write the prompt in chain so you don’t have to craft a fucking system message that matters just preload hard rules and soft code other rules in the dynamic creating.
  - You guys don’t think right. System prompts are not what you think. They are not rules for the system. It’s stargate.
  - You dial up your destination with your user prompts. The system message is your origin. Your perspective it’s the things you believe as the environment.

- All local models are different, its impossible (or very hard) to make a tool that auto formats prompts in a way a very niche/task specific model will do great on, but also one a large generalized model will do well on with the same prommpt.
  - Normally i rewrite prompts to the model im using, have experience with prompting and adapt to models overtime.

- ## [大家在开发agent reAct的时候，对话历史要怎么管理？ _202601](https://linux.do/t/topic/1536012)
  - 比如用户提了一个任务，agent 为了完成这个任务执行了多轮的 reAct 工具调用。 并返回用户结果 接着假如用户在同一个对话中，提出下一个任务，那么问题来了。新任务要保留上一次任务的工具调用全过程吗？
- 压缩对话历史, 可以参考 claude code openai 等的压缩方法

- 事实上，保存调用链的模型成本更低，因为舍弃前面的任何内容都会引起前缀缓存 miss，然后又要重新算一次前缀注意力，所以现在多数工具是不会改变任何已经产生的东西。
  - 上下文管理一般靠所谓的压缩，这个就各显神通了。Codex 最近有一篇很好的介绍，其中这段是相关内容
  - 不过，当 context windows 快炸的时候也许抛弃工具调用结果也不是个坏事，毕竟都快爆上下文了，缓存不缓存也无所谓。但没有爆窗口的担忧（或者像是 OAI 这种有单独压缩端点）的情况下，就不应该这么做

- ## 写 Prompt 最头疼的往往不是构思，而是反复的 “试错”。改个词效果变差，加句话逻辑变乱，把大量时间耗在了手动调试上。

  - https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/promptomatix /inactive

- 我更关心它能不能解决三件事：
  - •跨版本 prompt 回归（别今天好明天坏）
  - •不同模型迁移（别换模型就全崩）
  - •线上反馈闭环（别只在 notebook 里赢）
  - 能做到，才是真正的“终结手调”。

- 这个底层就是 dspy ，另外还有个 textgrad 好像也是做类似的事情，但看了几个demo似乎会生成非常复杂，非常长的 prompt，跟预期的精简高效的 prompt 有点差异

- ## [Simple trick that cuts context usage ~70% on local models : r/LocalLLaMA _202603](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1rso083/simple_trick_that_cuts_context_usage_70_on_local/)
  - Local models have tight context windows. I got tired of hitting limits feeding them large docs. Made a dead simple convention: annotate your markdown blocks with [SPEC], [NOTE], [BUG] etc. Then only load the block types you actually need for the task. Fixing a bug? Load [BUG] + [SPEC], skip everything else. 8k → 2.4k tokens. with any model, any framework. Just text.
- Claude Code and Qwen Code CLI are already pretty good at this. Their tool-calls only grab subsets of the code based on grep/find results and it's only if that fails that they move to ingest the entire file.

- Another way to solve the issue, is to have an indexing context project step, and get the agent to look at the index prior to planning then retrieve what they need from the index. Refresh index based on project change logs. This way they are only loading relevant context and it's not limited to a single document.

- ## [RFC: RAG-based dynamic skill injection to fix context pollution at scale · openclaw/openclaw _202602](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/discussions/20028)
  - buildWorkspaceSkillsPrompt() serialises every eligible skill into the system prompt on every agent turn. This works well with a handful of skills, but breaks down as the skill library grows
  - The current token-limit binary-search in applySkillsPromptLimits() mitigates the worst case by truncating skills, but truncation is arbitrary — the skills that get dropped may be exactly the ones needed for the current task.
  - Proposed solution: Replace the static full-injection with per-turn semantic retrieval (RAG)
  - Since ClawHub already classifies every skill as benign, suspicious, or malicious via VirusTotal + Code Insight (blog), RAG indexing is a natural enforcement point.

- ## [We've built memory into 4 different agent systems. Here's what actually works and what's a waste of time. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r21ojm/weve_built_memory_into_4_different_agent_systems/)
- What's a waste of time:
  - "Just use a vector store" -- Congrats, you built keyword search with extra steps and worse debugging. Embeddings are great for fuzzy matching, terrible for precise retrieval. Your agent will confidently pull up something semantically similar instead of the actual thing it needs.
  - Dumping full conversation logs as memory -- Your agent doesn't need to remember that the user said "thanks" 47 times. Unfiltered logs are noise with a few signal fragments buried in them. And you're burning tokens retrieving garbage.
  - One retrieval strategy -- If you're only doing semantic search, you're missing exact matches. If you're only doing keyword search, you're missing relationships. Pick one and you'll spend months wondering why retrieval "feels off."
- What actually works:
  - Entity resolution pipelines. Actively identify and link entities across conversations. "The Postgres migration, " "that DB move we discussed, " and "the thing Jake proposed last Tuesday" are the same thing. If your memory doesn't know that, it's broken.
  - Temporal tagging. When was this learned? Is it still valid? A decision from 3 months ago might be reversed. If your memory treats everything as equally fresh, your agent will confidently act on outdated context. Timestamps aren't metadata. They're core to whether a memory is useful.
  - Explicit priority systems. Not everything is worth remembering. Let users or systems mark what matters and what should decay. Without this you end up with a memory that "remembers" everything equally, which means it effectively remembers nothing.
  - Contradiction detection. Your system will inevitably store conflicting information. "We're using Redis for caching" and "We moved off Redis last sprint." If you silently store both, your agent flips a coin on which one it retrieves. Flag conflicts. Surface them. Let a human resolve it.
  - Multi-strategy retrieval. Run keyword, semantic, and graph traversal in parallel. Merge results. The answer to "why did we pick this architecture?" might be spread across a design doc, a Slack thread, and a PR description. No single strategy finds all three.
- The uncomfortable truth:
  - None of this "solves" memory. These are tactical patches for specific retrieval problems. But implemented carefully, they make systems that feel like memory instead of feeling like a database you have to babysit.
  - The bar isn't "perfect recall." The bar is "better than asking the same question twice."

- How are you doing the entity resolution?
  - On write: When a new fact comes in, we extract entities (people, projects, tools, decisions) with an LLM call. Then we check against a lightweight entity index. If "the database migration" looks like it's referring to the same thing as postgres-migration that we already have, we link them. Fuzzy match on names + a quick LLM "are these the same thing?" check for ambiguous cases.
  - On read: When retrieving, we resolve the query to known entities first, then pull all facts linked to those entities. This is where it pays off. Instead of hoping semantic search finds the right chunk, you're pulling a structured cluster of everything you know about that entity.
  - The trick is not overthinking it. We started with exact string matching and only added fuzzy/LLM resolution when we saw specific failures. 90% of entity mentions are pretty obvious. It's only the remaining 10% (abbreviations, nicknames, "that thing we discussed") that need the smart layer.
  - Biggest lesson: store the entity links, not just the raw text. If you only store chunks, you're doing retrieval on every read. If you store entity relationships, reads become lookups instead of searches.

- ## [Stop round-tripping your codebase: cutting LLM token Usage by \~80% using REPL driven document analysis : r/ClaudeCode _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1qeqj7r/stop_roundtripping_your_codebase_cutting_llm/)
- It's a completely different approach to handling large documents compared to tools like mgrep or specialized logic tools like Serena. 
  - If you have ever used mgrep then you know it is basically a specialized version of grep that is incredibly fast at finding strings across a filesystem but it lacks any real concept of state. Once a search finishes with mgrep the results are just text on your screen and if you want to do something with that data you have to pipe it into another tool or start a fresh process. 
  - Serena moves closer to what we want by using relational logic to synthesize programs but it still tends to treat each task as a discrete problem to be solved from scratch rather than a living environment.
  - Matryoshka gives you active memory within its REPL which functions like a persistent workspace where results stay live between turns. A tool like mgrep finds ten thousand lines of code it just dumps them out while Matryoshka stores those results as a variable handle within the sandbox. The agent does not have to pull every single line of text back into its limited context window just to count them or filter them further. Instead of burning through thousands of tokens to remind the AI what it just found the agent can simply refer to a pointer in the memory. This persistent state allows the system to behave more like a human developer who keeps a few tabs open to reference later rather than a script that forgets everything the moment it finishes a single command.

- ## [What has your experience been with context engines? : r/ClaudeCode _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1qz6r8f/what_has_your_experience_been_with_context_engines/)
  - Recently came across Augment Code and they have something called context engine that allows you to do real-time semantic searches on your codebase and other accompanying data. They also released it as an MCP and SDK recently.
  - Curious to know what are the results like with these tools? I'm seeing they claim better results when using their MCP with other tools like Claude code.

- The fundamental idea really comes down to two distinct problems:
  - Retrieval - finding the most relevant code chunks and ranking them by relevance
  - At some point the amount of relevant chunks will be too big to fit in a single context, and then the challenge becomes accurate answer synthesis at scale.  For large enterprise mono repos a single architectural query might have to crunch through millions of tokens. Even if you could fit it all in a single context, the U attention curve will produce very inaccurate results
  - Gets these two right and you have a better agent that's both more token efficient and more accurate. I'll also humbly nominate ChunkHound which is another OSS solution. ChunkHound solves both challenges while also being local first enabling fully offline operation

- ## [LM Studio and Context Caching (for API) : r/LocalLLaMA _202509](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1npatw9/lm_studio_and_context_caching_for_api/)
  - I'm running a Mac, so LM Studio with their MLX support is my go-to for using local models. 
  - When using the LM Studio as a local LLM server that integrates with tools and IDEs (like Zed, Roo, Cline, etc.), things get a bit annoying with the long-context slowdown. 
  - As I understand, it happens for 2 reasons:
  - The previous messages are reprocessed, the more messages, the longer it takes.
  - Especially on the Macs, the longer the context, the slower the generation speed.

- Models can be censored several ways:
  - Politically (ask it the positive things Trump/Biden did)
  - Sexually (try spicy roleplay with a proper character, easiest just to get an uncensored char like SexyB and go to town)
  - Legally (Ask it to build TATP, a nuclear bomb, thermite)

- ## [哪些令你惊艳的AI大语言模型提示词（prompt）？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/5415393695)
- 提示词大致分为下面几个部份：
  - 引导语或指示语：告诉模型需要处理什么样的任务，扮演什么样的角色。因为是一个超级大的语言库，先给定一个标签。让大模型知道是哪个领域的。方便后续的回复。
  - 上下文信息：提供足够的背景信息，以便模型能够更好地理解和处理请求。上下文信息可能包括具体情景、相关数据、历史对话信息等内容。历史内容：告诉大模型之前做了什么。
  - 任务描述：明确地描述你期望模型执行的任务。在处理复杂情况下，一两句说不清楚就需要对任务进行分层描述。
  - 输出格式指示：如果你对输出结果有特定的格式要求，可以给出一个输出示例。让大模型照着输出示例输出就行。
  - 限制条件：设置一些约束条件，可以是风格的约束，也可以是逻辑的约束。
  - 样例输出：提供一个或多个例子可以帮助LLM理解所期望的输出类型和质量。
  - 结束语：如果有必要，可以使用结束语来标示prompt的结束，尤其是在连续的对话或者交互中。
- 并非每个提示都要包含所有要素。根据实际需求和场景，恰当地组合它们，可以大大提高LLM返回结果的质量和相关性。
