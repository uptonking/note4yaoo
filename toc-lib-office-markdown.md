# toc-lib-office-markdown

## react-live

- usecase
  - https://github.com/coston/react-window-ui

- alternatives
  - 要在功能丰富和轻量方便间折中，过重的编辑器就偏向于在线ide了
  - https://github.com/uber/react-view
    - The first prototype of React View was even using react-live internally but eventually we needed a finer-grained control over the compilation process and a more flexible API. 
    - We also rely on babel and babel-parser instead of buble.
