- Regardless of XML-ness, you still have to check that the values are valid. With XML, you also have to check whether they're of the right type, because the format is so much more flexible.
  - It is far easier to repair and recover an xml file than a binary format.

- ## [The cost of ODF and OOXML | Hacker News _201205](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4032429)
- I have always wondered why Open Document standard would not be based around HTML instead of inventing new XML schema? Can someone who has more insight on ODF/OOXML tell me why HTML is not suitable for office document format?
  - HTML made for continuous display and re-flowing for different sizes.
  - ODF is for publishing, i.e. where you can have separate pages, with footers, margins, absolute position inside page (versus whole document), corrections tracking, authorship, figures.
- Open Office has a far richer format than HTML allows 

- That seems like a bad idea. TeX doesn't allow separation between markup and presentation very well. Something like DocBook with a presentation engine like XSLT might be better, if it wasn't for the verbosity of the XML source.

- How would ODF be better? Office Open XML standards are also publicly available if you need them.
  - üë∑üèª co-author of the ODF spec (2006 ISO) here, I also got involved via NLNet to work with my local standards office to improve OOXML.
  - The OOXML spec was offered to the ISO standard along an unusual path, a fast standardization lane. Where there was no option for any of the people reviewing it to actually change anything. It was rubber-stamped(‰∏çÂä†ÊÄùËÄÉ‰æøÊú∫Ê¢∞ÂºèÂú∞ÊâπÂáÜ„ÄîÂê´Ë¥¨‰πâ„Äï) in other words.
  - That fact alone doesn't mean it is a bad, but it is a bit of a red flag. The fact is, it is a really bad specification. It is a full 7000 pages long with lots of conflicting details.
  - Compare it to ODF which is 1/10th of the size. Has a lot of reuse of concepts and was written under OASIS, a standards organization, unlike the OOXML spec which was written by Microsoft and the full 7000 pages dropped on the world.
- I could imagine that some of the points you mentioned might be related to Microsofts focus on backward compatibility. Some of the points certainly might also have less noble reasons.
- ODF deferred some important things to be done in later revisions of the spec. For example spreadsheet formulas. OOXML on the other hand had hundreds of pages covering spreadsheet formulas, including detailed mathematical definitions and explanations for functions.

- My current favourite is OnlyOffice ‚Äì pretty concise interface and good compatibility. Unfortunately, there's no build for Linux on Arm yet, so I'm stuck with LibreOffice (not too bad either).
  - Their browser-based self-hosted solution has optional closed-source components, but the desktop app is pretty much open source
- Isn't OnlyOffice browser-based? Or is that something else?
  - It is, but they also package it as a desktop app using CEF. (It is one of maybe two Chromium-based desktop apps that I like, the other one being VSCodium.)

- ## [The biggest blocker to LibreOffice adoption? LibreOffice (2023) | Hacker News _202411](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42225260)
- Microsoft really doesn't want anyone to reliably copy their formats. Their standard is purposefully complicated and convoluted, it was almost rejected by ISO for this reason and it took heavy lobbying before it passed (I know of this personally as the ISO vote went through national ISO bodies).

- The biggest blocker to LibreOffice adoption is that the general purpose office suite is dying a slow death.
  - If you‚Äôre writing up some documentation for a business process, that should live in a system designed for that purpose where documents can be linked together and integrate with other systems. Examples include Confluence or Notion.
  - The second biggest blocker is that LibreOffice isn‚Äôt in your browser. It‚Äôs a slow-installing slow-loading clunky old desktop application.
  - The third biggest blocker to LibreOffice adoption is the dogshit ancient-looking UI. It looks nothing like a native application on any platform which constantly reminds you you‚Äôre using the knockoff of the Real McCoy.
