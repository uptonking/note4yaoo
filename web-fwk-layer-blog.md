## [How To Inspect Interactions In The Browser](https://www.builder.io/blog/inspect-interactions-in-the-browser)

  - Emulate focus so you can click freely in devtools
  - add debugging for when HTML subtrees change

- Solution #1: Emulate Focus Page
  - devtools > show rendering > emulate focus
- Solution #2: Break On Subtree Modifications
