# changelog

## [v33_20241219 ðŸš¨](https://blog.ag-grid.com/upgrading-to-ag-grid-33/)

- AG Grid 33 is one of our most significant releases ever: We've refactored the way Modules are implemented to deliver up to a 40% reduction in bundle size
  - We recommend using our latest Codemod to automate most of the migration process

- Refactoring the internals of the grid means we can now tree shake from a single bundle, reducing the size of your grids by up to 40%.
  - We've refactored the underlying architecture of the grid so that we can optimize our bundle size and let you choose the features you want to use, whilst tree-shaking out everything else.
  - Simplifying the library so that we only need to support 2 packages instead of 25 means better velocity for new features in future releases.
- Moving towards the Theming API means no more need for importing those CSS files above your component/somewhere in the app.
  - allows you to use the Theme Builder to quickly create custom grid themes with our intuitive UI.
  - Note: Whilst we're defaulting to the Theming API, we intend to support the legacy CSS themes for the foreseeable future, so you only need to migrate when you're ready.
  - Having the CSS in the code also means it is split per module adding even more savings to bundle size.
- Finally, we've removed a number of APIs which were deprecated in or before version 31.

## v27
