- ## How can you safely store passwords in a database?
- https://twitter.com/Franc0Fernand0/status/1745730683236917747
  - Storing passwords in plain text is a bad idea. Anyone with internal access to the database can see and grab them.
  - A standard solution to protect against such attacks is using a salt.
  - A salt is a random unique string that is added to each password during the hashing process.

- Here is the process used to store and validate the password using salt:
  1. The salt is stored in plain text in the database, ensuring that the hash result is unique to each password.
  2. The passwords are stored in the database, hashing them with the salt.
  3. A client enters its password.
  4. The system reads the salt from the database.
  5. The system combines the salt with the password and hashes it.
  6. The system compares the computed hash values with the ones stored in the database. If they are equal, the password is valid.
- Note how the salt is uniquely associated with each user's password.
- By storing the salt in the database, the system can always retrieve the correct salt to hash the password during login.
  - This approach ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hash values will be different due to the unique salts.

- Please use slow salted hash (PBKDF, Argon2, Bcrypt). Using simple hash may be not good enough. And when some older DB versions are using MD5, it's done for.
  - MD5 is not secure for password hashing due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks and hash collisions.

- ## how does single sign-on (sso) work
- https://twitter.com/milan_milanovic/status/1737027285549490434
  - Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single login. 
  - This is accomplished using a central authentication server that stores the user's credentials and verifies them for each application.
  - Some common types of SSO are: SAML-based SSO, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect

- ## Guys building SPA's, how do you design authorization checks in your apps? Especially when it's not a simple RBAC system.
- https://twitter.com/AmanVirk1/status/1736669755728130342
  - For example, check if the "user x is allowed to edit the post with id 1" or hide the edit button.
  - How and when do you communicate with the backend for this?

- For each object / resource that has to be displayed comes a list of permissions the actor has. Basically a collection of CRUD rights passed along the resource. currently implementing that system in our kotlin backend and will be implementing the frontend part in the coming weeks
  - Yeah, seems like a common practice as per other replies too.

- I normally keep whole permission object locally using state management library and then hide/disable button based on that. Only time backend call happens is if for some reason local state is not synced with DB, in that case backend communication will happen.
- What if the permissions is not a static list. For example, show the "Edit post" button, if user is the creator of the post?
  - In that case I return allowed actions list in API, using computed decorators. Where I can match current user ID with post creator ID.

- I usually create acls for each action and assign to users Then at the time of login i store in a local state and make a protected component that can accept 1 or many acl and based on that show hide the slot in between
- What if the list of permissions is not static. 
  - I make dependent ACLâ€™s, so i can check whatever condition before checking the ACL. 
  - Checking condition is always a static thing as that object will be having creator id and all in each block

- With HATEOAS you can state that an action is often associated to a link. You can then display the button if the action is in the resource.
  - Yeah, this is the approach I took with an app. The client was not much in following "HATEOAS", so we went hybrid and return a list of actions can perform on each resource and collection

- JWT with claims as part of the user payload

- Include the permissions associated with the user in each resource. Lazy, async & method based computed properties on lucid models would be neat for that
