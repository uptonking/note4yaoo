# workflow
- https://github.com/callstackincubator/flows-ai /240Star/MIT/202507/ts
  - https://flows-ai.callstack.com/
  - A lightweight, type-safe AI workflow orchestrator inspired by Anthropic's agent patterns. 
  - Built on top of Vercel AI SDK.
  - Last year, we built Fabrice - an AI agent framework designed to break down complex tasks into smaller steps.
  - We realized that AI agent systems today are essentially modern workflows where each node is an LLM call instead of a traditional function. 
  - The key difference lies not in the framework, but in the nature of these nodes: they have flexible input/output contracts.
  - This insight led us to redefine our approach and focus on an orchestration, so you can connect different (often incompatible input/outputs) together.
  - This library provides a simple, more deterministic way to build AI workflows. You can either explicitly define your workflow with loops and conditionals, or use an orchestrator agent to dynamically break down complex tasks.
