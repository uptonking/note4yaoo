    - [Spring Boot Primary Use Case](https://www.itcentralstation.com/product_reviews/spring-boot-review-71328-by-randy-masciana)
      - I primarily rely on Spring Boot as the core microservices framework
      - I have used it for both SQL and NoSQL solutions, including both caching and non-caching environments. 
      - With over 20 Spring modules to select for possible augmentation of the basic Spring Boot platform, there is nearly always a solution available.
      - many existing solutions can be integrated into the Spring Boot Java framework, even if that functionality is not part of an official Spring Boot add-on module.
      - Spring Boot has sped time to market and has also improved testability
