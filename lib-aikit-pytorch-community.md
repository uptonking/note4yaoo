- ## [TensorFlow is becoming the COBOL of Machine Learning, and we need to talk about it. : r/learnmachinelearning _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1raqecl/tensorflow_is_becoming_the_cobol_of_machine/)
  - if you actually look at what the Fortune 500 is hiring for, TensorFlow is essentially the Zombie King of ML. It’s not "winning" in terms of hype or GitHub stars, but it’s completely entrenched.
  - Look at academia; PyTorch has basically flatlined TF. If you’re writing a paper today in TensorFlow, you’re almost hurting your own citation count.
  - There’s also the Mobile/Edge factor. Everyone loves to hate on TF, but TF Lite still has a massive grip on mobile deployment that PyTorch is only just starting to squeeze. If you’re deploying to a billion Android devices, TF is often still the "safe" default.
  - The Verdict for 2026: If you’re building a GenAI startup or doing research, obviously use PyTorch. Nobody is writing a new LLM in raw TensorFlow today.

- TF Lite has been rebranded as LiteRT and now supports PyTorch input, as well as TensorFlow and JAX. So you can use PyTorch or JAX for model development and LiteRT for mobile deployment.

- just like programming languages people need to be able to transpose their knowledge from a framework to the other when needed (within the limits of generalisability, at least). Otherwise it means they don’t really know very well what they are doing, even in their framework of choice.
  - You shouldn’t choose PyTorch because you are a reasercher, or TF because you want the high-pay job. You should be able to put your hands on both.
