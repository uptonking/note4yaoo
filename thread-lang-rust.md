- ## Specific types like `Result` and `Option` in Rust offer  methods like `map` and `and_then` that enable a monadic interface, 
- https://twitter.com/debasishg/status/1753790041812558282
  - but Rust does not provide means to abstract over monads, which is an important difference with languages like Haskell. 
  - While having a common interface for `Option` , `Result` , and `Future` would be good, I don't miss monads in Rust where I can write imperative loops without worrying about shared mutable state.

- ## 🧮 graphs are quite hard to model with Rust, mainly because of the complex interaction between  ownership rules and managing mutable cyclic data structures. 
- https://twitter.com/debasishg/status/1752737782815195253
  - Was looking for options and found that arena based modeling (region-based memory management) is possibly the way to go. 
- Writing a linked list in C/C++ is trivial. In Rust it requires intermediate (almost advanced)  level of knowledge. When I first ended up using PhantomData, I thought to myself this is surely a hack.
- I don't think this is true. It's just that modeling graphs as nodes that have pointers to other nodes, as you might do on the JVM, does not work. But even on the JVM it is often better to model graphs with edges and node ids.

  - petgraph, a widely used Rust graph crate, also uses adjacency list rep for it's main Graph type

  - 写 Rust 的一个好处是，大家各自被编译器折腾后都会最终设计出几乎一样的解法，大大降低了交流成本……

- ## I wonder if someone has written a "Rust for C programmers" blog post to highlight the semantic differences between the two languages...

- For example, it took me a really long time to adjust to the fact that in Rust objects move in memory by default and you need to use Pin to keep them put. 
  - This is still sometimes counterintuitive to me when integrating with lower level things like `io_uring`. 
  - With C, once you `malloc()` an object, it's going to be at a fixed location allowing you to just pass a pointer to it. 
  - However, in Rust, the default behavior is the opposite, which leads to interesting bugs if you're not careful.
- Another thing that keeps biting me is mutability. 
  - In C, everything is mutable by default but in Rust you really are building with immutability by default. 
  - And usually, the way to make something mutable is to use interior mutability with something like `RefCell`.
  - I often make the mistake of passing a mut reference around only to eventually discover that it's pretty much impossible to evolve the code because the borrow checker starts to complain as soon as there's a possibility of multiple code paths mutating the same thing.
- Zig is certainly more natural language to integrate with the OS and libc interfaces. But Zig also has many of the same issues as C with memory safety and resource leaks, which makes Rust so attractive. 

- ## My 5 year prediction: we'll realize it was a mistake to write all of our high-level tools in a language built around systems-level memory safety (Rust)
- https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/1745094749717954705
  - The language itself is good but the entire semantics are built around something we don’t need and slow down development

- ## DWARF and frame pointers. It's a must-read if you're puzzled by perf, DWARF, frame pointers, profiling, or sampling.

- ## Nowadays I have doubts about using Rust primarily for building cross-language bindings. 
- https://twitter.com/Horusiath/status/1734385412800745686
  - It's great language, but once you need to pass Rust-idiomatic API to C FFI (or WASM) things are no longer so smooth.
  - The major advantage of Rust was that past alternatives were way worse.
- Any good alternatives? 
  - Recently Zig gets some attention and it seems to target this space. But I have too little experience to confirm yet.
- I was really hoping for F# to take that space. But the only space F# is taking is in C# features.

- Cross-language is by definition not smooth, but I tend to agree that C-like APIs are easier to integrate with. That said, the ecosystem for cross-language bindings with Rust is fairly extensive. I douby Zig would do much better here because you anyway need to build some wrappers.

- Swift really shines in mixed native language projects
  - Swift is a tri force! (imperative, functional, concurrent)

- ## Rust is mostly an uglier OCaml. Fight me.
- https://twitter.com/basus/status/1730321811773014186
- Rust uses typeclasses, ocaml uses higher order modules. They feel completely different IMO.

- ## The three registers of Rust
- https://twitter.com/greg_johnston/status/1727817195093209356
1. `.clone()` everywhere because let’s be honest I’m parsing a CSV file and will only run this once a year
2. `Vec<Box<dyn SomeTrait>>` will be good enough for now
3. `macro_rules` to derive SomeTrait on n-ary tuples up to 16 so you never allocate

- ## 刚刚搜索Rust怎么实现双链表。Rust的某reddit社区坚持认为，Rust不需要双链表，因为XX性能原因，所以你写不出双链表也不是大问题，Rust把这个弄得很难写，不是大问题。
- https://twitter.com/JXQNHZr1yUAj5Be/status/1710474773954768987
  - 但这问题是在双链表上吗？人家是抛砖引玉，问有cyclic引用的数据结构在Rust怎么处理的一般问题。
- 所有循环引用结构在 Rust 都难写，目前我体验最好的 safe 的方案还是 index arena 的形式（需要依赖 unsafe 的 dep）

- 问题是rust连做一棵有环的树，都是天方夜谭啊……链表本身也是树，rust在数据结构方面的局限性不应该被无视
  - 没办法，rust 用了所有权这种东西，循环引用确实很难实现
- 生命周期/所有权要求的偏序结构，和环状数据结构的固有矛盾。

- 我觉得这是对 rust 有点苛求了，难写应该是只考虑使用 safe rust 的部分。如果能在 unsafe 实现的基础上封装出 safe 的 public API ，就够了
- 每次看到这种牺牲自由度，换取安全性的编程语言，我都忍不住想到点别的东西

- 不是bug, 是feature。 双向链表用 `LinkedList<T>` 就好。

- ## [I rewrote 10k lines of JS into Rust over the last month. Here'a write up about i : rust_202010](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/k3jy5g/i_rewrote_10k_lines_of_js_into_rust_over_the_last/)
- Overall I've been brainstorming this change for a couple years. So I'd already shifted from a classical OOP mess with Shield/Weapon/Pillar inheriting from Permanent to one where everything is a Thing.
- I'd also moved towards having everything be referenced with integer ids which seems to be something Rust likes. This was originally so that a clone wouldn't need to update any references
- Rewriting let me come across a couple small bugs.

- ## I’m kinda fascinated by how Rust was the harbinger of next-gen JS tooling
- https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/1712005157611774056
- One that hasn’t been mentioned is that it borrows some ideas from functional languages (sum types, monads, etc.) which makes it more elegant for AST manipulation. Same reason compiler devs love OCaml.

- I think it actually wasn’t Rust. It was esbuild showing the way. SWC existed years before but didn’t really catch on until later. It wasn’t end to end (no bundler). ESBuild showed how fast native tools could be and others had to follow to keep up.
