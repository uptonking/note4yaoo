- ## Is there any multi-threaded #Java compiler? 
- https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1747000299447848964
  - `javac` is single-threaded AFAIK, what about others? 
  - Or is parallelization at the module level generally considered good enough?
- Maven seems to be parallel at the module level, as you said. (After some quick googling)
- I believe Eclipse `ecj` has support for it.
  - Been years since I had to care as it "just works" so not sure how much it utilizes/benefits from multiple corese.
- actually -  it might just be thats done at the IDE level not the compiler itself.
- Interesting, after a quick look at that issue it seems ecj itself can use multiple threads. That would be nice.

- ## Tracking Java Native Memory With JDK Flight Recorder
- https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1736455915627233293
  - JFR has added a few new event types for tracking memory allocations in Java 20/21
- I hope the proposition of @tstuefe of tracking any native allocation via an "preloaded interceptor" lib will be accepted.

- There are no stack traces to find the problematic code if it allocates too much?
  - For on-heap allocations, you can do so using the jdk. ObjectAllocationSample event. E.g. like so with a simple SQL query via JFR Analytics
  - I don't think for off-heap, there's an equivalent. You could instrument the relevant APIs using JMC Agent, though.
