- ## you need to wait until the previous layer has fully dried

  - 不完全3d的界面移动，适合实现版本历史
- I don’t like oil paint for that reason
  - yes i know that feeling—when you’re eager to keep going, but the painting makes you wait

- ## 我去年开始做了一个开源的 github贡献3d球体动效

  - GitHub Gitmos is insane

- ## if anyone knows how to make a globe with animations like this, plz dm, willing to pay
- https://x.com/nick_linck/status/1854658763707629912
- I made something like this... and it is open source

- claude's gonna have problems coding that

- I used CesiumJS at an internship a long time ago, but that's overkill unless you want a lot of zoom range with tiling etc.

- I have a general notion of how to start on how to do it, if anyone wants to try. React Three Fiber + Drei, put a sphere, then ask some AI to help you figure out how to translate IRL coordinates to a sphere

- Depends on which platform you want. WebGL with a lot of work it can be done for browser (you need a really good computer to run it) 
  - You can go with game engines (like Unity or Unreal) which will require less effort

- ## 使用Dall-E 3制作城市3D立体天气海报
- https://twitter.com/xiaohuggg/status/1720792193848484000
  - 可以把城市标志性建筑进行3D化，然后结合天气展示。
  - 结合GPT-4 ALL Tools可以将实时天气直接展示在立体图里。
- 导入runwayml做成动态，那就太帅了

- ## Wrote a simplified Wavefunction Collapse algorithm in Rooms to procedurally generate a little voxel city from tiles. 
- https://twitter.com/btco_code/status/1719672645938016484
  - You can edit the tiles/template

- ## I vectorised 10, 000 words from the english language & used tsne to visualise them in 3D space. This is a random sample of 250.
- https://twitter.com/JungleSilicon/status/1717775617104691491
  - The idea is to get a *mapping* of how Chat GPT thinks & clusters ideas together.
  - I've learnt two things.
  - English has a tonne of words nobody uses these days.
  - This would be much more interesting when comparing sentences within more specific domains.
- sweet 3d view! for #2 i'd amend it to *ideas* within a domain. It'd be like traversing ideas clustered by semantic relevance in an @obsdmd graph
  - I actually had the idea whilst using @obsdmd haha.

- ## We're loving these 3d histograms coming out of the Plotly #MATLAB library
