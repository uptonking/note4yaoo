- ## 使用Dall-E 3制作城市3D立体天气海报

  - 可以把城市标志性建筑进行3D化，然后结合天气展示。
  - 结合GPT-4 ALL Tools可以将实时天气直接展示在立体图里。
- 导入runwayml做成动态，那就太帅了

- ## Wrote a simplified Wavefunction Collapse algorithm in Rooms to procedurally generate a little voxel city from tiles.

  - You can edit the tiles/template

- ## I vectorised 10, 000 words from the english language & used tsne to visualise them in 3D space. This is a random sample of 250.

  - The idea is to get a *mapping* of how Chat GPT thinks & clusters ideas together.
  - I've learnt two things.
  - English has a tonne of words nobody uses these days.
  - This would be much more interesting when comparing sentences within more specific domains.
- sweet 3d view! for #2 i'd amend it to *ideas* within a domain. It'd be like traversing ideas clustered by semantic relevance in an @obsdmd graph
  - I actually had the idea whilst using @obsdmd haha.

- ## We're loving these 3d histograms coming out of the Plotly #MATLAB library
