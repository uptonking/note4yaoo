- ## Is Jinja2 still the king of the hill for Python templating engines?
- https://twitter.com/willmcgugan/status/1757724990160441764
- I love that jinja2 templates can contain basic logic and  be composed of subtemplates. And it certainly feels fast. What else do you need? I think it was one of your projects that made me realize that jinja is not just for web generation. Very powerful.
- It's certainly the one that I would consider. The only exception is that for Django projects I still use the Django templates.
