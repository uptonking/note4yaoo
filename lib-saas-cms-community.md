- ## [Reviving Sandstorm | Hacker News_202002](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22231922)
- If the failure of Sandstorm has shown one thing, it's that people will not maintain forks of software if the layer you're integrating with is too complex.
  - I'd much prefer if Sandstorm just shipped with an IdP and contributed OIDC implementations to downstream projects.

- For those who dont know what it is: Single Sing On with an App Store.
- Sandstorm is also an extremely security-oriented way of running packaged apps. It uses an advanced sandbox that has defeated many kernel zero-day vulnerabilities. It utilizes the Cap'n Proto serialization + RPC protocol, another security-oriented project of Kenton.
