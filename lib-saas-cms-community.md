- ## [Reviving Sandstorm | Hacker News_202002](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22231922)
- If the failure of Sandstorm has shown one thing, it's that people will not maintain forks of software if the layer you're integrating with is too complex.
  - I'd much prefer if Sandstorm just shipped with an IdP and contributed OIDC implementations to downstream projects.

- For those who dont know what it is: Single Sing On with an App Store.
- Sandstorm is also an extremely security-oriented way of running packaged apps. It uses an advanced sandbox that has defeated many kernel zero-day vulnerabilities. It utilizes the Cap'n Proto serialization + RPC protocol, another security-oriented project of Kenton.

- ## 有没有一种 CMS，可以定义表结构，然后用低代码拖一个可视化编辑器页面和表字段关联的 的 SasS

- 大部份低代码不都是这样吗？ 不过我觉得对程序员来说这不是最省事的模式。Django Admin 那种写好元数据几乎全部UI可以生出来更省事，不需要可视化
- 感觉绝大多数headlesscms都有这些功能
- 这不就是CMS系统应该做的事情吗？至少10多年前就有了，很多

- ## 快捷指令的编辑体验太屎了，难以想象做 20 行以上的指令有多痛苦。

- No code 所以并不会成为全部的未来
