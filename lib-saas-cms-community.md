- ## 🚀 [Show HN: I’m building open-source headless CMS for technical content | Hacker News _202306](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36324281)
- If you don't mind some feedback, I'll share some thoughts: My professional and personal experience tells me that markdown and a static site generators are the best workflow for technical writing. I can automate quite a lot, and do proper version control. A GUI CRUD and all the related requirements such as databases, would get on the way to keep the documentation in sync with the actual codebase.

- [Show HN: An open-source, collaborative, WYSIWYG Markdown editor | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36446045)

- From my experience, the benefit of Markdown is that it eliminates the need for WYSIWYG, because WYSIWYG is awful to work with.

- I love Obsidian's WYSIWYG implementation. It is WYSIWYG until you the cursor is touching any formatted element, at which point it reveals the Markdown that makes it appear that way e.g. h1 titles appear large, but clicking on them reveals the # at the start of the line

- Is anyone else using an internal wiki engine like Outline or Wiki.js, for their company or community? I am stuck self-hosting Outline because it has the most intuitive navigation and wysiwyg for non-IT people. I wonder if any better alternatives appeared since then.
  - I'd like to encourage you to check out Vrite as a whole. There's already Kanban for better management of content production process and I'd say the editor is comparable to Outline. Other views and more editor features are on the way.

- generic embeds aren't allowed - only CodePen, CodeSandbox, and YouTube. In Vrite, all the embeds are actually processed separately when auto-publishing to different platforms (e.g. Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode), that's why I don't want to allow generic iframes.
  - That said, I do plan to add some more embeds to the core (e.g. Twitter) but others will likely be supported through custom content blocks and extensions.

- ## [Reviving Sandstorm | Hacker News_202002](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22231922)
- If the failure of Sandstorm has shown one thing, it's that people will not maintain forks of software if the layer you're integrating with is too complex.
  - I'd much prefer if Sandstorm just shipped with an IdP and contributed OIDC implementations to downstream projects.

- For those who dont know what it is: Single Sing On with an App Store.
- Sandstorm is also an extremely security-oriented way of running packaged apps. It uses an advanced sandbox that has defeated many kernel zero-day vulnerabilities. It utilizes the Cap'n Proto serialization + RPC protocol, another security-oriented project of Kenton.

- ## 有没有一种 CMS，可以定义表结构，然后用低代码拖一个可视化编辑器页面和表字段关联的 的 SasS
- https://twitter.com/__oQuery/status/1753273583881867670
- 大部份低代码不都是这样吗？ 不过我觉得对程序员来说这不是最省事的模式。Django Admin 那种写好元数据几乎全部UI可以生出来更省事，不需要可视化
- 感觉绝大多数headlesscms都有这些功能
- 这不就是CMS系统应该做的事情吗？至少10多年前就有了，很多

- ## 快捷指令的编辑体验太屎了，难以想象做 20 行以上的指令有多痛苦。
