- ## I was today years old when I learned about the "\watch" option of psql for repeatedly running a query and examining its changing output.

  - `SELECT * from foo; \watch 1`

- In PG16 you will have a count option to stop it after n runs. Even better

- ## [PL/Rust 1.0: now a trusted language for Postgres | Hacker News_202304](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35501065)
- why would anyone want to use PL/Rust over PL/PQSL? what is the use case?
  - > PL/Rust is a loadable procedural language that enables writing PostgreSQL functions in the Rust programming language
  - Use to write PostgreSQL functions in Rust. Also
  - > The top advantages of PL/Rust include writing natively-compiled functions to achieve the absolute best performance, access to Rust's large development ecosystem, and Rust's compile-time safety guarantees.

- A crucial facet of optimization for computational triggers in PostgreSQL pertains to the implementation of event triggers, which enable operations to be executed in bulk (per DML statement) rather than on a per-row basis. It appears that, at present, PL/Rust has not incorporated support for event triggers. According to the documentation
  - Event Triggers and DO blocks are not (yet) supported by PL/Rust.

- I would suggest that the author creates a clone of a "simpler" DB like SQLite or Redis. Those have, as far as I understand, good C codebases, so understanding the system should be much easier.
