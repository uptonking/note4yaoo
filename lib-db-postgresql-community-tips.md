- ## I was today years old when I learned about the "\watch" option of psql for repeatedly running a query and examining its changing output.

  - `SELECT * from foo; \watch 1`

- In PG16 you will have a count option to stop it after n runs. Even better

- ## [PL/Rust 1.0: now a trusted language for Postgres | Hacker News_202304](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35501065)
- why would anyone want to use PL/Rust over PL/PQSL? what is the use case?
  - > PL/Rust is a loadable procedural language that enables writing PostgreSQL functions in the Rust programming language
  - Use to write PostgreSQL functions in Rust. Also
  - > The top advantages of PL/Rust include writing natively-compiled functions to achieve the absolute best performance, access to Rust's large development ecosystem, and Rust's compile-time safety guarantees.

- A crucial facet of optimization for computational triggers in PostgreSQL pertains to the implementation of event triggers, which enable operations to be executed in bulk (per DML statement) rather than on a per-row basis. It appears that, at present, PL/Rust has not incorporated support for event triggers. According to the documentation
  - Event Triggers and DO blocks are not (yet) supported by PL/Rust.

- I would suggest that the author creates a clone of a "simpler" DB like SQLite or Redis. Those have, as far as I understand, good C codebases, so understanding the system should be much easier.

- ## PostgreSQL has some limits on the number of partitions. 
- https://twitter.com/FranckPachot/status/1772630850854670729
  - YugabyteDB scales out with the automatic distribution of rows and index entries and uses partitions for lifecycle management or geo-partitioning, where the number is low
  - [Solve PostgreSQL Indexes, Partitioning, LockManager Limitations _202403](https://www.yugabyte.com/blog/postgresql-indexes-partitioning-lockmanager-limitations/)
- Interesting article. I feel that partitioning by hash is a different use case to partitioning by range of time (which I feel is the more common use in PG). Are you looking to cover that partitioning case sometime?
  - Yes I used hash here because it is easy to distribute without thinking of values. Will be the same on time: partition by range in postgres, or declaring the key as ASC or DESC in YugabyteDB. Can additionally partition by range on YB for lifecycle management, with few partitions)

- To me this seems applicable to hash partitioning but not when partitioning by range on time (e.g. monthly) though right?
  - It can. An index on the date will be: `CREATE INDEX on payments (created desc, payment_id)`

  - range sharded, split automatically when growing (you can pre-split if you know the values) 
  - Or, if the date is in the key, PK can be: `primary key (created desc, payment_id)`

- https://twitter.com/FranckPachot/status/1772895989394710668
  - Sharding by HASH is nice to immediately distribute, is the default on first key column
  - RANGE sharding is better for range queries

- ## Postgres doesnâ€™t support hints
- https://twitter.com/denismagda/status/1768411154651718087
  - but there is one mighty extension- `pg_hint_plan` - that brings the feature to the database 

- ## i wonder when "PostgresLite" will become a thing
- https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1751967157884432652
  - SQLite's single-file embedded no-server model makes getting started easy, but backends often need a database like Postgres
  - A reasonable alternative is to use SQLite in development and Postgres in production, but that often causes subtle issues. Some queries only work in Postgres. Some queries run very slowly in tests/development. The differences between the two is big enough to matter

- There would be a number of significant technical challenges in adapting Postgres to be single-file, embedded, no-server.
  - The biggest is probably that it currently has a 1:1 relationship between connection and processes. And requests within a request are processed serially. There has been a long standing debate about moving to multi-threaded but they always settle in staying multi-process onto.
  - Last time I scanned the mailing list it sounded like they were pretty determined to give it another go but I don't know how that developed after that.
  - Even if that got working it would almost certainly be more resource heavy than SQLite but that might be a good tradeoff for many use cases.
  - I have thought about what it would take to lift just like the SQL handling stuff, the query planner, on disk record format etc and then bolting that onto something like LMDB but I never got that far with it.

- This is why I think @deno_land created the KV abstraction. Would love to see something similar in Bun.

- Have you seen @tursodatabase ?  They created a fork of SQLite that contains a server mode and replication protocol to help you serve a SQLite database.

- ## How to use subtransactions in Postgres
- https://twitter.com/samokhvalov/status/1719228501658882268
  - TL; DR Don't use subtransactions, unless absolutely necessary.
  - A subtransaction, also known as "nested transaction", is a transaction started by instruction within the scope of an already started transaction 
- As a bottom line:
  - 1. If you can, don't use subtransactions
  - 2. Keep an eye on pgsql-hackers threads related to them and if you can, participate (help test and improve)
  - 3. If absolutely necessary, use them in lower-TPS systems only
  - avoid deep nesting
