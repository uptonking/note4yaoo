- https://twitter.com/d__raptis/status/1389161572958937092
- Hick's Law
  - "The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices"
  - Remove or hide non important actions. 
  - People want to complete their task in no time, without thinking.
- Fitts's Law
  - "The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target"
  - Always place your CTA in the right place, without distracting the user's flow. 
  - Not too early. Not too far away.
- Jakob’s Law
  - "Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know"
  - Always make sure that your important elements are in the right position.
- Miller’s Law
  - "The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory"
  - Don't overwhelm people with choices. 
  - Display only the necessary amount of information bc the human brain has limits.
- Law of Proximity
  - "Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together"
  - Group together relevant elements to help people understand information quicker & more efficient
- Von Restorff Effect
  - "It predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered" 
  - Highlight only your main CTA elements to drive attention to them.
- Doherty Threshold
  - "Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other"
  - Limit loading interactions under 400ms or make them enjoyable (eg. progress bar, facts) when it's not possible.
