## generative art 重复的线条、形状、色彩

# repos
- https://github.com/generative-design/Code-Package-p5.js
  - all of the source code for the book Generative Design: Creative Coding for the Web with JavaScript in p5.js.

  - Generative art with P5
- https://github.com/LingDong-/q5xjs
  - q5.js is a small and fast alternative (experimental) implementation of p5.js
  - mostly code-compatible with p5.js, meaning you can simply swap out the library
  - Currently, q5.js supports almost all of p5.js's 2D drawing API
  - It does not support 3D yet; 3D support will likely come as an extension to keep the main library lightweight. 
  - It excludes DOM and sound functionalities, though it is mostly compatible with p5.sound.js and p5.dom.js.
