# guide

- 使用primary/brand color的场景
  - displayed most frequently across your app’s screens and components.
  - to distinguish elements within a component
  - A secondary color provides more ways to distinguish your product.
    - secondary color is optional, and should be applied sparingly 
    - If you don’t have a secondary color, your primary color can also be used to accent elements.
  - Secondary colors are best for
    - Links and headlines
    - Highlighting selected text
    - Selection controls, like sliders and switches
    - Progress bars
    - Floating action buttons
  - Brand colors can be used in key moments
    - that associate those colors with specific actions and info
    - use color in bold ways to convey a sense of energy and excitement
    - use color in subtle ways to convey sophistication, emphasizing content, or suiting content in some other way(state changes)

- 组件交互的states设计
  - hover：加深所有背景色，如antd变浅，material-ui变深, material-io变色
  - active：上边框添加内部阴影，颜色更深，模拟按下效果
    - antd使用的是外圈波纹，material-ui使用的是内部点击处波纹
    - 点击过程中的状态是 `:active:focus`
  - focus：外圈添加阴影，颜色很浅(同hue)
    - 点击结束后的状态是 `:focus` ，结束后bg颜色就是点击前的颜色，但有外圈阴影
    - focus可用于多数键盘导航的元素，注意一致性，而hover和active仅用于交互类元素
  - disabled：降低不透明度
  - misc
    - mineral-ui交互过程：hover变浅，active变深，focus不变，也能表达变化感
    - 想要突出某些状态，还可以使用图标、文字、动画如震动
- design-tokens的创建
  - 抽象design tokens到json文件，然后基于theo自动生成样式到web或移动端格式
    - theo研发不活跃
- 渐变色的使用建议(个人)
  - 创建component library时尽量用palette里面的色阶，不用渐变色，可预留渐变色api
  - 基于组件库创建业务页面或主题时，可使用gradient colors增强设计感
- 颜色使用建议(个人)
  - 颜色模式使用HSB，而不是HSL
    - 设计类软件大多使用HSB模式，如PS,Sketch
    - 部分软件HSL的hue最大值为255，如wps,inkscape
    - HSB可与HSL计算转换，不用纠结
- Foundational elements, like color, are hard to change later
- theme-paid
  - 优点
    - 设计感强，可参考text,color,spacing,border,shadow,transition
  - 缺点
    - 依赖多，修改与定制难度大
    - 与业务结合不紧密

  •  336 gorgeous colors
  •  22 color scales
  •  6 gray scales
  •  12 steps per scale
  •  Accessibility baked-in
  •  Automatic dark mode
  •  Matching transparent scale variants
  •  Compatible with any styling solution
- We studied dozens of products to gather common patterns, use cases, and styles.
- There are 12 steps in each scale. Each step is designed for at least one specific use case.
  - This makes it much easier to know which color to use where. 
  - It also ensures that your design passes WCAG contrast ratios. 
  - But also, it means dark mode Just Works™.
- Because Radix Colors are designed around specific use cases, all you need to do for dark mode is apply a dark theme class to a container. Then your entire design updates automagically.
  - Each scale comes with a matching transparent variant for both light and dark modes (suffixed with "A"), which matches its opaque counterpart almost exactly.
- Accessibility was one of our top priorities with Radix Colors.
  - Steps 11 and 12 are designed for text. They're guaranteed to pass 4.5:1 contrast ratio on top of white, step 1, step 2, and step 3.
# color
- requirements
  - themable: consistent and distinct look and feel
  - scalable: additive and no breaking change when updating
  - accessible: content contrast is >= 4.5
- tricks
  - 使用hsb颜色模式，因为设计类专业软件多是如此
  - Darker color variation = lower brightness + higher saturation
  - Lighter Color Variation = higher brightness + lower saturation
  - make the movement of the hue match up with the movement of the saturation and brightness 
    - darken时使h靠近0(红)、120(绿)、240(蓝)，变亮时相反
- color-palette
  - grey-colors
    - Text, backgrounds, panels, form controls — almost everything in an interface is grey.
    - In practice, you want 8-10 shades to choose from (more on this later). enough to make sure you don't have to compromise too much
  - primary-colors
    - Most sites need one, maybe two colors that are used for primary actions, emphasizing navigation elements, etc. 
    - you need a variety (5-10) of lighter and darker shades to choose from.
    - Ultra-light shades can be useful as a tinted background for things like alerts, while darker shades work great for text
  - accent-colors
    - every site needs a few accent colors for communicating different things to the user.
    - yellow for a warning message
    - green to highlight a positive trend
    - You'll want multiple shades for these colors too, even though they should be used pretty sparingly throughout the UI
- The Predix Design System uses slightly-saturated grays for backgrounds and text. 
  - Bold hues and highlight colors are intended to be used in data visualizations, call-to-actions, and alerts
- gradient color
  - use cases
    - Header Gradient BGs
    - gradient effects are generally part of the overall dynamic interface
    - Logos & Text Effects
  - Gradients are good for highlighting extremes in a range of values.
    - especially in charts
  - Horizontal gradient
    - This is a concept design of an eCommerce app, including settings, authorization, and coupons. 
    - The designer presents the user’s coupon information by cards which use a uniform double-color horizontal gradient, highlighting the information on the card. 
    - Overall, the interface is minimalist and elegant.
  - Vertical gradient
    - How to make your weather APP stand out? 
    - The designer uses the vertical gradient very clever to create a sophisticated evening sky background with the APP’s timeline. 
    - The interface and function complement each other.
  - Diagonal gradient
    - The designer uses the diagonal gradient as a background, the warm gradual interface makes the interface more friendly and cordial. 
    - Besides, the diagonal gradient makes the interface more lively and rich, giving users a soft and humane AI product experience.
  - Gradient overlays on the background and head image
    - strengthen the sense of wholeness, making the user aware of other more important and crucial elements 
    - the overall image will be more mysterious, elegant and attractive.
  - Multi-angle multi-level overlay
  - Functional gradient effect
  - Multiple gradients are often inaccessible and are discouraged
  - Gradients should not be used to represent any meaningful progression or divergence.
  - We must go back to 2014 when it was all about flat design. 
    - Google had introduced their ‘Material design’ and Windows had their ‘Metro’.
    - They were great for low-resolution mobile devices where the designs looked clean, but alas, we were constrained by the variety of colors and with the advent of higher resolution mobile devices- it didn’t have the same aesthetic impact.
    - Can you name more than 20 flat colors? I bet you can’t. Flat colors are limited.
  - when flat design rose, designers were keeping away gradient in design
  - The reason for gradient’s rise is that flat design color combinations are extremely easy to cause homogeneity
    - Gradients let designers create something that feels new by blending colors.
    - You see gradients everywhere in nature, every fruit, every leaf 
  - A gradient is the gradual blending from one color to another. It enables the designer to almost create a new color. It makes objects stand out by adding a new dimension to the design and adding realism to the object. 
  - In simple terms, **gradients add depth** 
  - a gradual blending from a color to white or black (and playing with opacity) can mimic distance from or proximity to a light source. Gradients are more faithful to the real world because real life isn’t made of flat colors.
  - Gradients are eye-catching and memorable
  - Use a linear gradient for a square or polygonal area
  - Use a radial gradient for round areas
  - Learn basic types of gradients
    - use the appropriate type
  - Don’t choose colors randomly
    - You can use a gradient to communicate a change, guiding their gaze.
    - Choosing a bright color where you want your viewers to see, choosing a dark transition to create a sense of shape or maybe a dull color to reduce its visual weight
    - keep a few things in mind when choosing colors.
  - introducing the 3-stop gradient
    - add a third stop in the gradient at about halfway between the original two colors.
    - When you create a gradient from a solid color to transparent color AKA a color fade effect, make sure both stops have the same color. different colors means at the midpoint you have the ‘transition phase color’ at 50% opacity instead of a visually smooth effect.
    - It doesn’t stop at 3, you can create as many stops in the gradient to gain more control over the transition
  - Create smooth transitions
    - Ideally, the user shouldn’t notice the place where one color flows to another
  - Convey emotion or mood
  - Don’t forget about color contrast
    - Always check the color-contrast ratio to ensure accessiblity

- HSL(色相、饱和度、亮度)在概念上表示了一个双圆锥体和圆球体
  - 黑色在下顶点，白色在上顶点，最大横切面的圆心是半程灰色
  - 使用HSL的有：inkscape
- HSB(色相，饱和度，色调)又称HSV，在概念上可以被认为是颜色的倒圆锥体
  - 黑点在下顶点，白色在上底面圆心
  - 设计类软件大多使用的是HSB，如PS、sketch、GIMP
- HWB(Hue, Whiteness, Blackness)
- HSB vs HSL
  - HSL is similar to HSB. The main difference is that HSL is symmetrical to lightness and darkness.  
    - In HSL, the Saturation component always goes from fully saturated color to the equivalent gray (in HSB, with B at maximum, it goes from saturated color to white).
    - In HSL, the Lightness always spans the entire range from black through the chosen hue to white (in HSB, the B component only goes half that way, from black to the chosen hue).
  - HSL的特点
    - 只要L为0，颜色就为黑色，只要L为100，颜色就为白色，S和L可认为没有关系
    - 当L在0~100之间(不包含两端)时，S从0到100为灰度值到最饱和色
  - HSB的特点
    - 只要B为0，颜色就为黑色，B为100时为亮度最高的色值
    - 当B在0~100之间(不包含两端)时，S从0到100为灰度值到最饱和色
    - 特别地，当B=100，S=0时，颜色为白色
  - 黑色产生条件相同，都为L或B为0，为0时无论怎么改变S都为纯黑色
  - 白色产生条件不同，HSL的白色需要L为100，HSB的白色需要B为100且S为0

- color meaning
  - Red: Passion, Love, Danger
  - Blue: Tranquil, Calm, Responsible, Safe
  - Black: Mystery, Elegance, Evil
  - White: Purity, Silence, Cleanliness
  - Green: New, Fresh, Nature
- 60–30–10 Rule
  - 60% is your dominant hue, 30% is secondary color and 10% is for accent color.
- avoid using gray colors without saturation. In real life, pure gray colors almost never exist. The same goes for blacks. Remember to always add a bit of saturation to your color.
- The best color combinations come from nature. The best thing about looking to the environment for design solutions is that the palette is always changing.

# interaction
- choices
  - mouse
  - keyboard
  - touchscreen
  - on mobile devices, the events that trigger these pseudo-classes can become conflated. 
- tips
  - hover, active, focus的书写顺序
    - hover写在最前面(否则一直hover色)
    - active写在最后，点击过程才反馈，否则会被hover或focus颜色挡住
- states
  - default
    - brand color
    - One common mistake is to choose a button style that isn’t differentiated enough from input fields
  - disabled
    - Disabled components are unavailable for interaction, so they don’t receive hover or focus and are not subject to WC3 contrast compliance standards
    - For the dark themes, disabled values are two full steps lighter than their respective background. 
    - For light themes, they are two full steps darker. 
    - One of the most popular methods of styling disabled buttons is to lower their opacity. 
  - hover：建议取一个步长的邻近值
    - In the IBM default themes, these colors fall outside of the core palette steps and act as “half steps” between two adjacent colors.
    - `:hover` triggers when a user brings their mouse over an element.
    - Hover states are usually represented by a change in background-color (and/or color)
  - active
    - The active state is two full steps lighter for values between 100 and 70 and two full steps darker for values between 60 and 10
    - `:active` triggers when you interact with an element.
      - Holding down your left mouse button on an element (even non-focusable ones)
      - Holding down the Space key (on buttons)
    - active and focus 
      - When you hold down the left mouse button on a focusable element, you trigger the active state. You also trigger the focus state at the same time.
      - When you release the left mouse button, focus remains on the element
      - Above is true for most focusable elements except links and buttons.
      - links
        - When you release left mouse button: :focus remains on link (if the link’s href does not match an id on the same page). On Safari, focus goes back to `<body>`
      - buttons
        - When you hold down left mouse button: Triggers :active and :focus state on Chrome only. Does not trigger :focus at all in Safari and Firefox (Mac).
      - If you want clicks to focus on buttons, you need to add this JavaScript as early as you can. 
      - Holding down Space triggers :active on buttons, but holding down Enter doesn’t.
      - Enter triggers links but it doesn’t create create an active state. Space doesn’t trigger links at all.
    - styling hover and active together
      - mouse click and keyboard both get feedback
    - These(hover & active) states will only apply to some users and input types. Not everyone uses a mouse, not everyone uses their fingers.
    - It’s way, way more fun to design these states with awareness of everything else
  - focus
      - The focus state usually appears as a Blue 60 border in the light theme and as a White border in the dark theme.
      - Elements can receive focus in two ways:
        - When users *tab* into a focusable element
        - When users *click* on a focusable element
      - Focusable elements are: 
        - `<a>` , `<button>` , `<input>` , `<textarea>`
        - Elements with `tabindex` attribute
        - Users cannot tab into an element with tabindex="-1", but they can click on it. The click triggers focus.
        - On Safari and Firefox (Mac), clicks do not focus the `<button>` element
        - When you click on a link ( `<a>` ), focus remains on the link until you lift your finger from your mouse. When you lift your finger, the focus gets redirected elsewhere if the href points to a valid id on the same page.
      - When a user hits tab, they don’t know where the focus will go to. They can only guess. This is why we need a prominent change a user’s attention attention to the focused element.
        - The default focus style of browsers is okay most of the time
        - Adding an outline
        - Creating animations with movement
        - Adding box shadows
        - Changing background-color or color (bad,confusing with hover)
      - Without it, navigation via keyboards or other directional input devices is virtually impossible
      - It should not rely entirely on color and value changes, which can be difficult for some users to identify.
  - selected
    - The selected state is one full step lighter for values between 100 and 70, and one full step darker for values between 60 and 10
  - toggle/expanded
    - Dropdown or expand/collapse toggles. These usually incorporate a caret, arrow or plus/minus icon as well.
  - dragged/pressed

# typography
- contrast 对比度
  - 文本色与背景色的“对比度”不足会导致美感不足，甚至视觉不适
  - 对比度是指显示屏上两种相邻颜色之间的亮度或发出光线的强度的差异计算值。这个比值的范围在1到21之间（通常写为 1:1 到 21:1）；该值越大，则对比度越高
  - W3C组织制定了Web内容无障碍指南(WCAG)，涉及了一些建议，这些建议可使Web内容更容易访问accessible
- AA： This is the sweet spot for text sizes below ~18pt. `>=4.5`
  - 普通文本是4.5:1，大型文本3:1
- AAA: This is enhanced contrast `>=7`
  - 普通文本是7:1，大型文本4.5:1
- 字体大小的分界线
  - 普通文本: 小于18磅的常规字体或14磅的加粗字体 
  - 大型文本: 大于18磅的常规字体或14磅的加粗字体
- 文本使用带有半透明度的黑色或白色可以提高对比度
  - 在彩色背景上使用灰色文本会降低对比度
  - 使用不同半透明度的文本，用于区分标题、正文、描述文本、提示文本和icon
- 正文使用黑白色，在大段的正文中使用彩色文本不利于阅读 
- 页面中色彩不宜过多，谨慎使用彩色文本
  - 应该把彩色留给按钮、链接、开关等组件，这样做的好处是文本层次鲜明
  - 过多色彩会让内容缺乏重点

# ant-design色彩
- Ant Design将色彩体系解读成两个层面：系统级色彩体系和产品级色彩体系
  - 系统级色彩体系主要定义了蚂蚁中台设计中的基础色板、中性色板和数据可视化色板
  - 产品级色彩体系则是基于系统色彩进一步定义的符合功能、业务和产品调性的颜色
  - 在配图插画以及展示性页面中可以适当打破色板的限制
- 产品级色彩体系
  - 品牌色是体现产品特性和传播理念最直观的视觉元素之一
      - 在色彩选取时，需要先明确品牌色在界面中的使用场景及范围
      - 在基础色板中选择主色，建议选择色板从浅至深的**第六个颜色**作为主色
      - **应用场景**包括：重要信息高亮、关键行动点、操作状态、图形化等场景
  - 功能色代表了明确的信息以及状态
      - 应用场景包括：成功、出错、失败、提醒、链接等
  - 中性色
      - 主要被大量的应用在界面的文字部分，此外背景、边框、分割线等中也常见
      - 中性色的定义需要考虑深色背景以及浅色背景的差异，同时结合WCAG 2.0标准
- 在由浅至深的色板里，第6格色彩单元格普遍满足WCAG 2.0的4.5:1最小对比度(AA级)，我们将其定义为色板的默认品牌色，对比度过低会导致文本难以识别
- 对于v3版本色板生成算法，主色的选取很重要
  - 一般主色选取饱和度较高、明度较高的颜色才能更好地匹配这个色板生成算法
  - 部门内部预定的饱和度和亮度不能低于70
  - 3.x版本舍弃了与某个浅色深色值进行混合的形式获取渐变色板的方式，而是直接对HSV的三个值进行递减/递增，这样做使得代码容易理解，但是也有一些弊端，饱和度递减的值/明度递减的值很大，这对于主设计师对主色的正确选取的要求很高
- 自然界中几乎没有纯白/纯黑色的东西，因此在使用这三种颜色给人的感觉不真实
- 当主色亮度或饱和度过低的时候，色号小于5/大于5的变化速率差异增大，这在开发的时候渐变色的与主色的对比度可能会失衡，视觉效果不好
- ant-design的色板生成算法经历了线性取值(v1-先与深色混合)、bezier取值(v2-HSL模型-先与深色混合)、根据与主色差值直接计算(v3-HSV模型-主色选取很重要)

# Mineral UI
- Mineral ui system contains a gray ramp that is used across themes, and several theme ramps.
- Base color swatch
  - Base color is the dominant color within the themes; 
  - it is the swatch that will be used the most throughout the UI components. (mostly 10 ramps)
  - Theme-60 is always the base color for light templates (white text on theme color)
  - Theme-50 is the base color for dark theme templates (black text on theme color). 
  - The contrast ratio of these two colors is always 4.5:1 or higher.
- Swatches near the base color
  - These colors will support hover, active, and focus states for the base color in actionable elements such as buttons, links, and form elements.
- Beginning and End swatches
  - These swatches are most often used as accent backgrounds colors, or to give visual weight to a UI element, in both light and dark themes. 
  - For instance, theme-10 (light theme) or theme-100 (dark theme) could be used as backgrounds on selected items in a drop down menu or table row.
- 需要注意的颜色
  -  If we edited the Lime color to be 4.5:1 contrast with white text, it no longer looked like lime anymore (more like goose poop).
  - If the color contrast ratio of yellow is more than 4.5:1, it would look like the current Bronze color
  - Orange, used for the “Warning” variant in our theme, was easily confused with our “Danger” variant (Red). Bronze was born as a compliant way

# how-to-build-design-system
- Design tokens are the atomic elements we use to store design related variables that describe things like colour, animation, spacing, fonts, shadows etc.
  - text, color, spacing, border
  - shadows, transition
- Good design is also hinged on principles. Principles serve as guidelines, something to adhere to when approaching your design system. 
  - semantic
  - designer and developer
  - compatible when updating

- button
  - With buttons, interaction springs to life.
  - primary button
    - Set a System’s Stylistic Tone: color,text,icon
    - Set a Verbal Tone, Too: imperative or cute
    - Invert Buttons When Backgrounds Get Complicated
    - Limit One Per Page, Unless Repeating a Primary Action
    - Design and Build a Button’s Arc of Interaction
      - default > hover > active/pressed > focus > disabled > loading
    - Be Resilient to including additional elements with one layout 
  - secondary button
    - Ensure Secondary ≠ Disabled
    - want to pair a secondary option with that inviting, saturated primary. 
    - Solve for secondary colors and disabled states in concert.
  - ghost button
    - Ghost buttons rely on only a border and label of the same color while lacking a background fill.
    - Behind that label rests an uncertain future,sometimes making the label difficult to read
  - button group
    - From Toggles to Toolbars, Make Buttons Play Nice Together
    - A button group pairs a primary with one or more other options
  - variant
    - size
  - Distinguish Buttons from Links
  - Enrich Variety with Menus & Zones
  - For Buttons, Use `<button>`
    - If there is any kind of href you could put on that link that makes sense, by all means, use an anchor.
    - Buttons are expected to be triggered using the Space key, while links are expected to be triggered through the Enter key
  - states
    1. By default, active and focus are both off.
