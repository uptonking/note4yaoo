## popular

- https://github.com/getify/TNG-Hooks
  - /923Star/MIT/201907/js
  - provides hooks (i.e., useState(..), useReducer(..), useEffect(..), etc) for decorating regular, standalone functions with useful state and effects management. 
  - Custom hooks are also supported.
  - An Articulated Function is the TNG equivalent of a React function component: 
    - a regular, standalone function decorated with a TNG hooks-context, 
    - which means hooks are valid to use during its invocation.
  - Unlike a normal pure function, which takes all its inputs and computes output(s) without producing any side-effects, 
    - the most straightforward way to think about an Articulated Function is that it is stateful (maintains its own state) and effectful (spins off side-effects).
