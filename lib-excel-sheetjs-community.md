- ## [What is the status of this project?_202111](https://github.com/protobi/js-xlsx/issues/163)
- This branch is currently not maintained. The unique strength of of this overall project is it can both read and write XLSX, XLS, XLSM
  - The original intent of this fork was to add the ability to read and write styles.
  - The original author instead added that functionality independently within a private commercial version.
- But for most applications we use protobi/msexcelbuilder and i think for many others `exceljs` is a leading option.

- [status of this project? _201812](https://github.com/protobi/js-xlsx/issues/125)
- This library supports background colors, etc, lots of examples in example_style.js. 
  - Try installing it from github directly (git install github:protobi/js-xlsx) rather than npm.

- ### [Is this project still maintained? _201710](https://github.com/protobi/js-xlsx/issues/90)
- 201803: This repo was meant as a temporary branch to SheetJS/js-xlsx
  - Styles have since been independently integrated into SheetJS PRO version

- ## [xlsx has moved away from npm last week, and left the npm version to be seemingly unsupported without any warning to the users : javascript_202205](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/uithnp/xlsx_has_moved_away_from_npm_last_week_and_left/)
- +1 for ExcelJs, I found it pretty easy to use and I think the documentation is really good. 
  - Last time I used it didnâ€™t support images in the header which I hope it adds
