- ðŸ§© Annotations are tagged values that are used to add metadata to transactions in an extensible way. 
  - They should be used to model things that **effect the entire transaction** (such as its time stamp or information about its origin). 
  - For effects that happen alongside the other changes made by the transaction, state effects are more appropriate.
- ðŸ§© State effects can be used to represent additional effects associated with a transaction. 
  - They are often useful to model changes to custom state fields, when those changes aren't implicit in document or selection changes.
