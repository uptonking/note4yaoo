- ## üå∞ Seamless dragging between windows; second columns are in iframes
- https://twitter.com/alexandereardon/status/1765874214471614652
  - Yes, this works in Safari and Firefox
  - It‚Äôs a vanilla js library, so it can be used with anything like react/svelte
- Wait, doesn't the only way to drag rich elements out of a window, using the native drag and drop APIs, require the image of the thing being dragged to be translucent?
  - It's not too translucent (thankfully)
- Ah yeah from desktop I can see that it's not fully opaque. On the phone it looked impossibly perfect. It still looks very good though

- Does this mean you can drag between tabs? Kind of like dragging an image into messages?
  - Yep

- From experience you can support with browser <-> native application as well. The nice thing about data transfer

  - Basically it‚Äôs `dataTransfer` of `DragEvent`. Can support native applications too without much work. 
  - I‚Äôve made experiments with that in the past, but it‚Äôs too advanced feature for 99% of the users
- By the way, the real issue of supporting this feature is you already have the item in the list on a different window, what is the right UX? If you receive item with missing data locally what to do you do? In real apps it can lead to many UX/sync issues that mostly don‚Äôt worthy
  -  I‚Äôve tried to support it at AnyDo, and very fast I got to the conclusion it will cause more problems. Moreover,  `dataTransfer` is cool, it‚Äôs the same mechanism when drop files or anything else. In reality dropping files are most usable and he could do some cool demo too. Think of Dropbox like

- These are the drag and drop edge cases nobody wants to write code for. Massive respect

  - Some applications leverage iframes for sandboxing (eg for addons), Site builders, etc
  - I'm pretty hyped about this, as achieving something like  this on your own is really hard. pdnd makes it real safe and straight forward to set up
