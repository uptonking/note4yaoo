# lib-office-note-taking-examples

# guide

- web版 vs 桌面版 vs vscode扩展版
  - 现有插件生态、编辑器切换
  - 要在侧重web(no-server)和侧重本地(c/s或b/s)的架构上做取舍，主要考虑数据源、数据量、性能
  - 还要在csr/ssr上做选择，没有大而全的架构

- files-first vs database-first
  - 若要实现web版产品，files-first的抽象在数据访问和查询时会很不方便

- note-solutions
  - web-first: TiddlyWiki
  - database-first: joplin, trilium, siyuan
  - files-first: notable, marktext, zettlr, typora, obsidian
  - ide: vscode-with-ext
  - interactive: jupyter, observablehq
  - offline-first: typora
  - 其他产品参考: pdf标注、电子书epub

    - I keep thinking about some reasonable ways to integrate with the file system as well - my ideal solution would be to sort of "mount" some directory into trilium 
    - This gets complicated with possible filename conflicts, the fact Trilium also supports versioning etc. In the end it would also create a mess - directory full of files which would need to at least contain some UUID. The benefits compared to just storing them in SQLite get smaller

  - 🆚️ [MarkText + Zettlr _201907](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/issues/1130)
    - Zettlr knowledge management features are what sets it apart from Mark Text
      - Files can have identifiers (the default is a timestamp, but the user can define a custom format using regexp).
      - Zettlr has a syntax to easily type links to other files [[fileId]]. 
      - Support for tags: Zettlr recognizes the typical syntax for hashtags #tag.
    - Mark Text is really just a markdown editor. It will not add the features of note taking, such as tags, metadata, etc. 
  - issues-not-yet
    - [Manage Tags](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/issues/641)
      - Mark Text is a pure markdown editor, there is no storage function, and no notebook function is added
    - [What do you want to do with plugins?](https://github.com/marktext/marktext/issues/375)
      - 现有parser代码仍有扩展上的困难，希望以marked为原型，以插件方式实现每个标记，让每个标记实现rule,renderer
      - marktext 在编辑器内部的渲染不是依赖 marked的，是通过snabbdom 来进行渲染的，所以其是marked 只是提供了block 的解析（不包含inline语法）以及输出markdown 时候会用到（包含block 和 inline 语法）。

- obsidian dataview /5.8kStar/MIT/202312/ts
  - https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview
  - https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/
  - A high-performance data index and query language over Markdown files, for obsidian
  - Treat your Obsidian Vault as a database which you can query from. 
  - Provides a JavaScript API and pipeline-based query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages.
  - **Dataview generates data from your vault by pulling information from Markdown frontmatter and Inline fields** .
  - Markdown frontmatter is arbitrary YAML enclosed by `---` at the top of a markdown document which can store metadata about that document.
  - Inline fields are a Dataview feature which allow you to write metadata directly inline in your markdown document via `Key:: Value` syntax.
  - [Obsidian Dataview: Turn Obsidian Vault into a database you can query from | Hacker News_202205](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31407781)
  - https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases
    - Obsidian is not open source software and this repo DOES NOT contain the source code of Obsidian. 
    - However, if you wish to contribute to Obsidian, you can easily do so with our extensive plugin system.
  - https://github.com/blacksmithgu/datacore /MIT
    - Datacore is a work-in-progress re-imagining of Dataview with a focus on 2-10x better query and rendering performance, as well as fully interactible views.
    - Datacore is fundamentally the same thing as dataview - an index over Markdown files that supports live-updating views and metadata. 
    - However, Datacore focuses on substantial index changes for performance, as well as a new sleek UI which completely replaces traditional Dataview queries. 
    - Datacore supports all query operations that Dataview does, with some extra functionality.
    - WYSIWYG Views: Datacore queries now use a responsive table view and can be manipulated with a table editor much more akin to what you would see in places like Notion and Airtable.
    - Live Editing: Values inside of table views can now be edited; task views include more nuanced rendering of metadata like due date and more operations for manipulating tasks directly.

  - 接近实时的多设备双向同步
  - 可使用 CouchDB 以及兼容的服务，如 IBM Cloudant
  - 支持端到端加密
  - 插件同步 (Beta)
  - 从 obsidian-livesync-webclip 接收 WebClip (本功能不适用端到端加密)
  - 请勿与其他同步解决方案（包括 iCloud、Obsidian Sync）一起使用。在启用此插件之前，请确保禁用所有其他同步方法以避免内容损坏或重复。
  - [Obsidian 各种同步方式体验](https://irithys.com/obsidian-sync-exp/)

    - 基于 WebDAV，S3 存储或 CouchDb 的后端 API ，Obsidian 笔记的 API
    - 可借助 Obsidian 插件 Remotely-Save 插件，或者 Self-hosted LiveSync (ex:Obsidian-livesync) 插件 CouchDb 方式，保存消息到 Obsidian 库
    - 一个简易图床，附带命令行上传工具

- https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save /apache2/202401/ts
  - Yet another unofficial Obsidian plugin allowing users to synchronize notes between local device and the cloud service. 
  - Supports S3, Dropbox, OneDrive, webdav.
  - Vaults can be synced across mobile and desktop devices with the cloud service as the "broker".
  - End-to-end encryption supported.
  - Scheduled auto sync supported. 
  - Sync Algorithm open for discussion.
  - No Conflict resolution. No content-diff-and-patch algorithm. All files and folders are compared using their local and remote "last modified time" and those with later "last modified time" wins.
  - [Is this project abandoned?_202304](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save/issues/280)
    - Admittedly I was too busy and too lazy to update the plugin in the past few years
    - livesync and obsidian-git doesn't meet my needs because the first one needs a db server and the second one is too complicated for non-tech. 
  - [被 Remotely Save 劝退：：木木木木木](https://immmmm.com/off-remotely-save/)
    - 同步机制没有 “文件保存触发同步” 不够 “丝滑”；
    - 定时同步时有一串（8 条）通知条，同步后笔记还会 “闪烁”（重载）一下，不够 “无感”；
    - 同步冲突以文件的最后时间为准，而非 “局部增量” 同步，若多端在 “定时同步” 时间间隔内对同一文件进行操作，那就直接错乱

  - We are in the early stages of designing an alternative plugin that does not make use of existing code by ObsidianMD team.
  - [Show HN: Open-source obsidian.md sync server | Hacker News_202308](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37247767)
