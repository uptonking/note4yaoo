- ## [Ask HN: Is anyone using cloud dev environments (e.g. Codespaces/Replit) at work? | Hacker News _202310](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37934488)
- I have not used a full blown online environment. Except maybe VSCode remote using SSH. I repeatedly find anything that requires a network call somewhere in between a serious impediment disrupting the flow of development. Sometimes I find myself in slow laggy situations with ssh to the point I prefer Mobile Shell mosh. VSCode remote (or similar) via ssh obviously becomes painful.
  - Most cloud environments are also limited in terms of what you can do. e.g: issue sudo while running a process, attach to a process with a debugger.

- I work on CodeSandbox, so that creates some bias :). We've been working on our own CDE solution, though we've taken a different spin to improve speed and cost.
  - Our solution is based on Firecracker, which enables us to "pause" (& clone) a VM at any point in time and resume it later exactly where it left of, within 1.5s. This gives the benefit that you won't have to wait for your environment to spin up when you request one, or when you continue working on one after some inactivity

This gives the benefit that you won't have to wait for your environment to spin up when you request one, or when you continue working on one after some inactivity
  - It also reduces cost. We can pause the VM after 5 minutes of inactivity, and when you come back, we'll resume it so it won't feel like the environment was closed at all.

- I thought CDEs were a pretty cool idea years ago until I discovered Nix and specifically "nix shells".

- ## [Microsoft Dev Box | Hacker News _202205](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31493458)
- Would this be a competitor to https://www.gitpod.io/ ?
  - It isn't a match, because this is a full Windows desktop running over Web streams/RDP.
  - It is a competitor to Citrix, VMWare and similar offerings.

- ## [How to code, build, and deploy from an iPad using Gitlab and Gitpod | Hacker News _202204](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31060363)
- Gitpod is VSCode front running on the browser and the backend is in a Linux container on their cloud. 
  - They have a running script you can commit which lets you run any command while starting up or even specify your own docker (which inherit from theirs). 
  - This allows you to create dev environment for most common languages. This article also shows how to use Gitlab CI/CD on every push.
- Pros: No need for high end laptop/pc (Shared on 16cores). Free HTTPS exposing for every port on the machine. Docker included. Standardize you dev environment (including VSCode extensions). Amazing if you are handling multiple projects and context switch between them a a lot (K8s, Dockers, nodejs, React and more) or for education with no hassles.
- Cons: Not all VSCode extensions are supported, as some are proprietary. Only support Gitlab, Github, Bitbucket. Free tier limited with 50 hours/month

- The moment you want to do web development or create iOS apps you hit a wall. The form factor is great but the software is terrible for coding.
- It's a strange situation where, in order to code on an M1 iPad, you might end up phoning into a box either you own or in the cloud, and that box is likely much slower than the M1 is on a single-thread.

- I started using their product last year, but ended up coming back to VS Code + .devcontainers. 
  - I've found their configuration scheme (`.gitpod.yml`) confusing and lacking documentation. 
  - I couldn't get trivial stuff like Prebuilds to work correctly.

- I'm currently using my iPad as a VNC client for a headless Mac mini, it's pretty close to a laptop. But need to figure out how to get a better wifi connection from my home office to my bed room btw.
  - See https://Ghuntley.com/internet for ideas.

- So far the best solution I saw using a tablet for coding was connecting the tablet to a rapsberry pi and sing network over usb-c and doing the work in the Pi with ssh connection. Is jenk but it does work.

- GitPod uses vscode, and vscode uses monaco. Monaco is very mobile unfriendly.

- Gitpod is thin client for hipsters. Unlike Virtual Desktop Infrastructure which is all about unburdening system administrators at the expense of developer happiness. Cloud-based, reproducible developer environments like Gitpod are all about developer experience and sparking joy for software engineers.

- ## üöÄ [devpod: Codespaces but open-source, client-only, and unopinionated | Hacker News _202306](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36407477)
- I'm glad this space is expanding. This is created by the authors of Loft.sh and Devspaces, both really great solutions to the most common problems of developing natively in a K8s cluster.
  - DevPod is basically Vagrant but with containers, which brings a ton of benefits over the former VM-centric design. You can maintain an entire team (or organization) with one immutable development environment, to get away from the constant toil of fixing random problems on random people's dev environments that happened because they changed something locally and don't have an immutable environment to restore.
  - The fact that it's self-hosted means you can take it anywhere (your laptop, GCloud, AWS, Azure, etc). Containers means you can save resources or scale it, reuse public containers and container ecosystem tools. Unopinionated means you aren't forced to use one IDE or platform. Open Source means you can read the source to figure out what's going on and hack in a solution if needed.

- DevPod is another implementation of the devcontainer spec, the most used one being the aforementioned devcontainer cli which vscode uses, or supplies, via its integration.

- üÜöÔ∏è What are some of the competitors in this space?
  - Gitpod, a SaaS competitor to Codespaces. 
  - Coder, which I guess is the more enterprisey self-hosted Codespaces alternative? 
  - This project, Devpod, seems to be a polished experience but not centralized like Coder.
  - I recently stumbled upon Recode, which looks like a more indie take on the problem.

- It's a lot older but I would say Vagrant intersects with this space https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant
- Vagrant was fantastic pre-Docker and is still arguably more useful for certain cases, but I recall having issues running it last I tried. Based on the website, VirtualBox still lacks stable ARM64 support. Would "boxes" downloaded from the Vagrant cloud need to be built for ARM64 as well, or does it emulate?
  - It does not emulate. My org has been deprecating Vagrant ever since IT started issuing Apple Silicon as an option. Replacement is Docker Compose, or cloud VMs for software with heavy disk I/O.

- I've been using devenv for new projects. I like it so far. Some might find nix (which it requires) to be overkill, but I think that's underestimating how devilish of a problem it's solving.
  - devbox is a similar idea, but is more approachable for those who don't know nix.

- Bridge to K8s, CloudShell Editor, Cloud Code, Coder, DevSpace, Eclipse Che, Garden, GitPod, GitHub Codespaces, ksync, Kubectl-warp, Nocalhost, Okteto, Squash, Stern, Skaffold, Telepresence, Tilt

- Coder‚Äôs big difference is that it uses Terraform for provisioning, so it can do Docker/Kubernetes as well as VMs

- At CodeSandbox we're also working on this! Main focus of us is that we're running the environment in Firecracker microVMs, which allows us to snapshot and clone environments very quickly. 
  - This enables us to create a VM for every branch, which comes with the added advantage that every branch automatically has a snapshotted preview environment that can resume in ~2 seconds.

- DevBox is a full VM with everything installed. Codespaces is a container with a web or SSH interface.

- Toolbox is not a developer environment, but rather a tool to provide 'a toolbox' to a container host, like the older Atomic, or CoreOS releases that are immutable. Dsitrobox is close to toolbox, but also not similar in providing a coder setup.

- Looks like a nix-env clone, cool nonetheless

- What would you say are the main differences between devpod and DevSpace. Do they compliment each other? Should devpod at one time in the future displace DevSpace? Would love to get your view on that.
  - Yep, as we see it they compliment each other quite well. DevPod takes your workspace to the cloud and DevSpace let's you develop against your Kubernetes cluster - potentially the same one you used to start your workspace.
  - Internally we use both in our development setup, spinning up remote workspaces using DevPod, installing DevSpace and kind into the devcontainer, then using DevSpace to develop against the cluster. See the vcluster setup as an example

- ## [Show HN: DevPod ‚Äì Codespaces but Open Source, Client-Only, and Unopinionated | Hacker News _202305](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35964590)
- DevPod is built on the devcontainer.json standard to create reproducible dev environments. 
- Compared to hosted services such as Github Codespaces, JetBrains Spaces, or Google Cloud Workstations, DevPod has the following advantages:
  - Open Source: DevPod is 100% open-source and extensible. A provider doesn‚Äôt exist? Just create your own.
  - Client-only: No need to install a server backend. DevPod runs solely on your computer.
  - Cross IDE support: VS Code and the full JetBrains suite is supported. Other IDEs can be connected through ssh.
  - Rich feature set: DevPod already supports prebuilds, auto inactivity shutdown, git & docker credentials sync, with many more features to come.

- Port-forwarding and using your local IDE is already working in DevPod today. We also added auto-port-forward where it watches what happens inside the container and then starts port-forwarding automagically.

- File sync: That is a great idea. We got that in DevSpace already as you mentioned and we definitely think this could be super valuable in DevPod as well. Right now, a git push and then pull is required to get things from inside DevPod updated on local but with sync this would be even easier and faster.

- I enjoyed using gitpod a few times, this seems similar. How do they compare?
- There are 3 main differences: 
  - 1) DevPod is based on GitHub/Microsoft's devcontainer.json standard while GitPod has their own file format 
  - 2) DevPod is client-only more like Terraform where the client creates/manages things directly using cloud credentials vs GitPod is a server-side solution to manage and provision dev workspaces 
  - 3) DevPod has a provider concept similar to Terraform that allows you to provision dev environments in ANY infra vs GitPod is mostly a hosted solution (they do have the option to host it yourself as well but it's usually you install it to one cloud and then provision in that same cloud vs DevPod is 1 client (no server, see point 2) and then you deploy the dev env in ANY cloud or even locally in Docker or local k8s)

- ## [Ending support for self-hosted Gitpod and moving our source to AGPL | Hacker News _202212](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33907897)
- CEO from Gitpod here. Some background on why we moved to a managed enterprise cloud product: there are parts of Gitpod itself that are closer to a Kubelet then a Kubernetes application. We use much of the Kubernetes surface, interact with containerd, and use bleeding edge Linux features. The only way you make Cloud and Self Hosted co-exist is to have one codebase. What we deployed in SaaS we wanted to deploy in Self-Hosted. But not all Kubernetes are created equal (think GKE node label, EKS custom AMI to get Linux kernels but not other places). Today there are features in SaaS that are not available in Self-Hosted. 

- Open source without self hosting capability is just crowdsourcing your engineering team. Documented and supported or bust. The cloud is a prison.

- Interested to see if they can successfully pivot to full SaaS. It seems like with the recent AWS announcement of CodeCatalyst and Github CodeSpaces (both of which are free with an additional easy to use paid model), Gitpod has been backed into a corner. I hope they do well, but the odds are stacked against them as the enterprise selling machines that are Amazon and Microsoft are incredibly difficult to fight as a startup. 
  - With Gitlab also apparently working on their version of CodeSpaces, it seems like maybe the best position for Gitpod is an acquisition (possibly by Atlassian).

- Still self hosted alternative https://coder.com and Eclipse Che https://www.eclipse.org/che/.

- Is there enough of a community around Gitpod for it to be supported that way?
  - Unfortunately no. It is stupidly complex to be able to contribute to Gitpod as the build tooling (werft) automation is only accessible to employees thus a community never formed. During my time there I tried to get this resolved and implement some form of automation around community contribution w/CLA but both of these problems went no-where/were not prioritised.

- i dont understand. gitpod self hosted is gone and source is agpl so can someone continue a fork of gitpod self hosted?
  - I think the point is that they no longer support self-hosting. You can still self-host it, since it's AGPL after all, but they probably won't help you nor document how to self-host. This effectively pushes enterprises from self-hosting to their new Dedicated offering.

- ## [Is there a simple self hosted alternative to Github Codespaces/Gitpod? : r/selfhosted _202302](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/10z04tk/is_there_a_simple_self_hosted_alternative_to/)
- Yes, code-server allows you to develop remotely on a different machine which is what I'm looking for. The problem is with managing code-server and setting up full development environments. This is what Hocus aim's to solve - it will provision and manage code-server/jetbrains-gateway for you so you don't have to think about it. You install one app on your desktop and suddenly you get all the benefits of gitpod/github codespaces including prebuilds 
- Coder is nice but they unfortunately don't support prebuilds like Gitpod/Github Codespaces

- Gitlab also has a web ide. I am using it for code hosting, issue tracking, ci/CD and a docker registry. Code server might be the better ide, but I'm loving my gitlab for all it's features.
