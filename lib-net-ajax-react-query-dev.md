## [You Might Not Need React Query_202305](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/you-might-not-need-react-query)

- ### @tkdodo wrote a great post recently on "You Might Not Need React Query", pointing out that RSCs and R-Q solve _mostly_ the same problem, and if you use RSCs you _probably_ don't need R-Q
- https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1666564887055671297
  - Same thing goes for RTK Query

- [Thinking in React Query_2023ReactSummit](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/thinking-in-react-query)

- ### Key Takeaways:
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1667279661980610565
  1. react-query does not care how you fetch: It is an async state manager as long as your provide is a promise
  2. revisit staletime: tune this accordingly; most people don't need it set to it's default, at 0
  3. useEffect and onSuccess callbacks are deprecated

- ### We will very likely be removing the onSuccess / onError / onSettled callbacks from `useQuery` in v5
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1647341498227097600

### [Breaking React Query's API on purpose | TkDodo's blog](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/breaking-react-querys-api-on-purpose)

- `useQuery` has three callback functions: `onSuccess`,  `onError` and `onSettled`, which will be called when the Query ran either successfully or had an error (or in both cases). 
  - You can (apparently) use them to execute side effects, like showing error notifications
  - Users like this API because it's intuitive. Without those callbacks, you would seemingly need the dreaded useEffect hook to perform such a side effect
  - Many users see it as a huge selling point of React Query that they don't need to write `useEffect` anymore. 
  - In this example, the effect clearly shows the **drawback** of this approach: If we call useTodos() two times in our App, we will get two error notifications!

- üëâüèª The best way to address this problem is to use the global cache-level callbacks when setting up your QueryClient
  - This callback will only be invoked once per Query. 
  - It also exists outside the component that called useQuery, so we don't have a closure problem.
- Just add an onDataChanged callback then that will fire whenever data changes.üí° I initially thought this to be a good idea, but then again, how would we implement that callback? 
  - The currently existing ones can be invoked after the queryFn runs, because we are already in a side effect scope. But if we render and read from the cache only, we can't just invoke a callback during rendering
  - We would have to spawn our own `useEffect`. And that is something you can do in userland, too, if there is really a case where state-syncing is unavoidable. 
  - Sure, it's not the most beautiful code ever written, but state-syncing is not something that should be encouraged.

# cookies

## security

### [Using HTTP cookies - HTTP | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

- A cookie with the `Secure` attribute is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol. 
  - It's never sent with unsecured HTTP (except on localhost), which means man-in-the-middle attackers can't access it easily. 
  - Insecure sites (with `http:` in the URL) can't set cookies with the Secure attribute. 
  - üí° But someone with access to the client's hard disk (or JavaScript if the HttpOnly attribute isn't set) can read and modify the information.

- A cookie with the `HttpOnly` attribute is inaccessible to the JavaScript `Document.cookie` API; 
  - ‚ùì ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàEditThisCookieÊµèËßàÂô®Êâ©Â±ïËÉΩÂ§üËØªÂá∫httpOnlyÁöÑcookie
  - it's only sent to the server. 
  - For example, cookies that persist in server-side sessions don't need to be available to JavaScript and should have the HttpOnly attribute. 
  - This precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
# discuss-faq
- ## [fix(query-core): correct placeholderData prevData value with select fn](https://github.com/TanStack/query/pull/5227)
- for v5, replace `keepPreviousData: true` with `placeholderData: (prev) => prev`
# discuss-authors

- ## 

- ## Unless I hear a good reason not to, TanStack Query v5 will ship with a default `staleTime` of 30s instead of 0.
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1687454784209448962
  - This has mostly upsides, but also a slight downside
- `staleTime` defines the time when your data goes from `fresh` to `stale` . As long as it's fresh, `useQuery` will only read data from the cache, without refetching.
  - With `staleTime:0` , you'll always get a background refetch on mount / window focus / reconnect / key change.
  - zero is as aggressive as it gets, and I think too aggressive for most apps. I mostly advised to set a default staleTime globally, and overwrite it when needed.
  - It's what allows you to call `useQuery` wherever you want to without fetching every time. It's what makes window focus refetching great, because it won't happen _every time_. That feature is turned off prematurely(ÊèêÂâçÁöÑÔºõËøáÊó©ÁöÑ), largely b/c of staleTime:0.
- Why 30s though? Is this a random value?
  - It's a metric I borrowed from the nextJs team - they use that value for the **Router Cache**. For navigations happening in that timeframe between routes, it's better UX to see the page as it was when you left it, even if that data is outdated. I tend to agree with that.

- make sure its documented in a big banner with bold text, to avoid the issues NextJS had by surprising everyone with their 30s caching that wasn't anywhere until a few days ago.
  - Will do. The big problem in nextjs is that you have absolutely no way to opt out of that 30s cache. Query always lets you customize everything 

- Great! 30s is a good value and I always set this minimum. SWR has a default of 2 or 5 for window focus refetching interval and it was always annoying AF. 30 is a solid value, sometimes it works with even higher values!

- Disabling refetch on focus is one of the first things I disable in RQ, so this is welcome.

- ## [Data fetching on the web still sucks | Hacker News_202101](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25930177)
- Completely agree! I believe that op-log sync with CRDT-based atomic operations are a better solution.

- ## [using the data of one query to fetch the data for another](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/3147)
- The dependent queries section in the docs shows that quite nicely, and I would just put the two things into a custom hook so that the GC issue doesn't even arise because as long as queryB is used (which uses query A, query A will also be used)

- ## [Recommended pattern for list-details-layout](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/1269)
- This is what I do right now in production:
  - I have a custom hook (let's call it useArticles) to get the list to show in the sidebar, the list doesn't have all the info, only the needed to be displayed in the list (e.g. it doesn't have the whole content).
  - I have another custom hook (let's call it useArticle) to get a single item to show in the content area, this has the whole information including the content which can be large.
  - Then, when something is updated in one of the articles I trigger a revalidation of the list and the individual article, this way the list will always be updated with that current info of each item.

- ## [Supporting a stream-based flow (EventSource, SSE)](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/418)
  - Just curious if you would be interested in supporting a new use case for streamed data. For instance, it could support EventSource.
  - From what I can foresee, this would "look-like" the infinite query flow - with the difference being that it's not the front-end pulling new data but the server sending it intermittently(Êñ≠Áª≠ÁöÑÔºõÈó¥Ê≠áÁöÑ:).

- if you can write a custom hook that uses the `useInfiniteQuery` hook and does this with an event source, then we can have a better discussion on whether something like this should belong in React Query, or simply as a new npm module like `react-query-use-event-source`

- I made two rough things:
  - One using async generator to pull data
  - one using simple callback paradigm

- I have found a simpler solution using the `queryClient` API and updating the data from the event source events. Maybe this is an anti pattern for react-query but it works nicely for me. 
  - why would you do that with useQuery instead of with a normal useEffect ? The problem I see with this approach is that the queryFn can run multiple times due to background refetches, and each time it does, you're leaking an event source and a listener, because there is no way to clean it up inside the queryFn. 
  - Initially I did try this with a useEffect but ran in to some problems, the main one being reusability.

- ### [Using Sockets](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/358)
- sockets are not transaction based, so there would be nothing to "refetch" if you will. 
  - Unless you are using your socket to both request and receive data, then I guess you could theoretically set up a new system 
- IMO that's a tone of work for little benefits. 
  - If you are considering this, then I would suggest you introspect on your architecture and ask yourself what your true technical requirements are for your data. 
  - If you are working with transactional data, then you're going to want a transactional interface, like promises. 
  - If you are working with streaming data, then you won't really be able to rely on any transactional features of it any way.

- ## [Is there any need to use Context API with React Query?](https://github.com/TanStack/query/discussions/3859)
- Putting data from react-query into the context api is not the worst idea though - it's just a decoupling of some sorts, just like prop drilling.

- I think this is a valid use-case, and it's also not the usual state-syncing anti-pattern, as the single source of truth is still the query itself (or whatever other source we have for that context). 

- One thing to keep in mind is to memoize the children to the Provider to avoid unnecessarily re-rendering the whole tree, and you also cannot do fine grained subscriptions like you can do with e.g. the select option on useQuery

- ## if you're using a framework like @remix_run or @nextjs , you might not even need React Query. 
- https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1543623611877138433
  - Fetch server-side whenever feasible, and client-side only when necessary.

- üí° do initial fetches on the server (e.g. next), but do refetches on the client (react-query). 
  - Same as rendering really: initially on the server, but then on the client only.

- ## üÜöÔ∏è useSWR or React Query?_202310
- https://twitter.com/iamjonjackson/status/1718016755136671999
- And the most important reason: RQ has @TkDodo - one of the most skills devs I know and a very helpful attitude and open to support its community.
- 
- 
- 
- 


- ## Common scenario: You want to pre-fill some local state (e.g. the selection of a Dropdown component) with server state, e.g. a PersonSelect that fetches person data and selects the first option.
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1672168421339938818
  - How can we do this without `onSuccess` or `useEffect` ? We DERIVE it
  - State should be as minimal as possible. Imo, our user hasn't really "selected" the first value - they have selected nothing, so unless they change that, they are happy with the provided default. We don't need to put that into our state, we can derive it.

- React Query is a data synchronization tool. If a background refetch occurs that you haven't accounted for, it will result in a bad UX if our users select an entry from the dropdown, and their selection will be suddenly overwritten. Very unexpected!

- Alternatively, we can split things up into two components: A wrapper that fetches data and the actual select that takes an `initialSelection`. This will push state further down, but refetches are completely ignored with that.

- ## Non-RxJS Observables in the wild... tanstack edition
- https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/1656746366553452573
- Yes, yes, it's more of a "Subject"... which is an observable.
- Incidentally, @tannerlinsley , I don't know all of the usage here, but as a pro-tip, *if* you can move away from an array of listeners to a `Set` it will help perf a lot. (But comes with idempotent listener adds, obviously)
  - (I've been wanting to do that to RxJS Subjects, but it would be too broad of a breaking change for us)
  - Prior art is `EventTarget` , though: `addEventListener` is idempotent.
- üí° heh, I actually did the `array->Map` switch for the Redux core in v5 alpha
- Ooh do XState next (we love our bespoke artisanal handcrafted observables)
  - All ActorRefs (what is returned from interpret(...)) are observable

- ## Should we return a typed `setData` function from `useQuery` ?
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1650104471555383299
- I want a type safe way to manipulate the cache, which this could be.
  - The current version of queryClient.setData is more or less just explicit typecasting and is error prone, it‚Äôs not really type safe (the type passed to setData doesn‚Äôt have to match the queryFn return)

- ## [Why mobile apps are usually authenticated via token, not cookies - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34593045/why-mobile-apps-are-usually-authenticated-via-token-not-cookies)
- üëâüèª One concern is application scalability. When you use a cookie it normally goes like this:
  - User logs in. Cookie is issued with the session ID in it. The session ID is persisted in a shared session store in the backend. Cookie is stored in browser.
  - Cookie is presented at each request. The backend takes the session ID from the cookie and checks in some sort of database if the session ID is known.
- So basically you have this overhead of looking up the session ID on every request. 
  - The alternative is to come up with some clever request routing, so that each user hits a fixed server where she was authenticated on. So I can't easily introduce a new server.

- a token like a JSON web token is just a crytographically secured claim, that one was authenticated (and maybe additional claims about the user). It goes like this:
  - User logs in. Token is issued that proves that claims that the user was authenticated (+ optional user info). The token is cryptographically signed by the issuer.
  - The token is presented at each request. As it is signed, we can detect if the token is valid and unaltered. Also we can say who has issued the token.
- Now, as each server can cryptographically prove that the token was issued by a trusted party (in most cases on of our backend servers), the backend server is sure that the user was authenticated. 
  - However, you don't need that shared session storage anymore. 
  - So, e.g. it does not matter at all which server a request goes to. 
  - This enhances scalability and makes ops a little bit easier.

- üëâüèª A cookie is limited in size to 4KB. 
  - A token is not limited in size, so it can transport more information (of course a token should be small nevertheless).

- üëâüèª Theoretically, you can control in your web app when to send the token. 
  - It's not necessary for antonymous resources. 
  - A cookie is sent with each request.

- üëâüèª A cookie is issued for one domain. 
  - If you access another domain, then you are in trouble. 
  - A token on the other hand can be sent to any domain.

- üëéüèª A cookie can be protected by the HttpOnly flag, so that it can't be accessed in Javascript. That makes XSS hard(er). 
  - On the other hand this is not possible with tokens.

- discussion

- Using JWT doesn't free you from keeping state. You still need something like a session store to check tokens against. You need to keep a blacklist of invalidated tokens if you want to support users logging out or invalidate tokens after a user changes their password. 
  - you need to check if the token is still valid in the case it has been invalidated by the user, such as on change of password.
- Yes for the refresh token you'd need storage as you say, but that should be a lot less often than verifying a signature on the short-lived access token. It depends on the application. 

- ## Are you storing access tokens in localstorage, and if so, why aren't you using cookies instead?
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1556617005620396032
- 1) GDPR:
  - no, using cookies is _not_ bad for GDPR, and you don't need user consent for mandatory, first party cookies. GDPR is about marketing cookies like facebook pixel, google tag manager etc ...
- 2) XSS:
  - no, cookies are not "better for XSS". What does that even mean? If an attacker can run arbitrary javascript on your page, you are screwed, not matter what.
  - If you are the _targeted_ victim of an attack, you better have a good content security policy (CSP) set up.
  - üëâüèª However, localstorage can be read out by _all_ JavaScript running on your page, and cookies cannot! That gives them a clear advantage in case of a widespread vulnerability or one 3rd party lib that gets compromised.
- 3) localstorage is "simpler" to setup:
  - Lots of confusion here about having to read and parse the cookie on the frontend...
  - NO, you don't touch the cookie on the frontend. It's a blackbox / pass-through. Backend sets it, backend reads it. Get the username from somewhere else.
- 4) I want JWT, not sessions on the server:
  - The idea is to put the JWT _into_ the cookie, you don't need a stateful session to use cookies.
  - One is the auth mechanism (jwt, sessions), the other is the transport mechanism (cookies, authorization header). You can mix and match!
- 5) cookies have a size limit
  - okay, maybe. never reached that. would love some real life example of when that went south for someone.
- 6) cookies lead to CSRF attacks
  - The biggest downside for cookies is largely eliminated when you use `same-site` cookies. All major browsers support them. If you want to be absolutely safe, add CSRF tokens. Still better than localstorage.
- The end. Don't store security relevant information like tokens in localstorage.

- http only cookie is the way

- 
- 
- 

- ## I think "Auth in React Query" would be a good blog post title but the content would be lame. Like: "Don't do it, use cookies. The end" üòÇ
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1644793984085008386

- A single Cross Site Scripting can be used to steal all the data in these objects, so again it's recommended not to store sensitive information in local storage.

- Counterpoint, don't use cookies
  - Use an authorisation header with OAuth or similar mechanism for creating your JWT
- Then suddenly your JavaScript has to handle that, where it can be stolen by browser extensions or third party scripts like ads. Cookies are the safe way. Also with OAuth and JWT.
- Literally not a problem
  - bold claim without proof
- You can still store your tokens in a httpOnly cookie, and even better make sure to only apply them to the headers on a server-side call. Best of both worlds ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- 

- a strong CSP and a backend that provides the right CORS headers

- Not so easy.
  - If you have client agnostic APIs that use autorisation bearer tokens, you don't want to put a gateway in front of them just to do cookies for web use cases.
  - But please in this case, put your token in memory and not in localStorage.

- ## An engineer on my team is using react-query‚Äôs pagination system in an interesting way I hadn‚Äôt seen before
- https://twitter.com/chrisheninger/status/1644093991917588480
  - [Polling for new content using react-query useInfiniteQuery | by Matt Miller | Apr, 2023 | Medium](https://mmiller42.medium.com/polling-for-new-content-using-react-query-useinfinitequery-18395bb98894)

- This is nice. Minor tradeoffs:
  - if there's a refetch, everything will go into the first page, because it reuses the timestamp. So you'll go from multiple, small pages to one big page.
  - You can't use refetchInterval for polling but have to setup your own with fetchNextPage

- ## I managed to build an "offline-first" React app using @tan_stack Query. 
- https://twitter.com/crutchcorn/status/1641767947164319745
  - It loads data once from server, lets you turn off data, do everything offline, & sync again when online. 
  - It even has a manual diff for when server data updates when offline. 600 LOC
- https://github.com/crutchcorn/offline-first-react-app
  - this POC is _really_ for a React Native app.
- What‚Äôs redux persist for though if you‚Äôre using react query persist?
  - Diff probs to be solved - React Query is server data handling while Redux is for local-only data.
  - Redux specifically persists all of the diffing that needs to occur with the user.
  - Seemed like a good solution given:
  - 1) This data cannot become stale
  - 2) Updatable outside of comps
- is there anything else you think could be improved in this code sample?
  - Just one thing: In the diff-handler, you're reading:
  - const isOnline = onlineManager.isOnline(); 
  - This isn't reactive, so your component won't re-render because the online state changes. You'd need `onlineManager.subscribe()` in an effect (or via useSyncExternalStore) for that

- ## I'm building a react-query-like library but for specifically tuple-database backends. 
- https://twitter.com/moonriseTK/status/1636536122711867393
  - Its super early, but I really like how I setup these tests. 
  - By using a deferred server, I can render the hook, make any assertions, respond to the request, then make any assertions afterward.
  - Building this for an app I'm working on. The real benefit is that you basically never have to refetch...by subscribing to the key, the server just tells you when to update. So the implementation becomes a lot simpler than something like react-query which is very generic.
- it seems similar to evolu.  crud to local firstly, then sync
  - Yeah very similar. I will have to dig into their implementation, i wonder if they do subscription or just refetch.

- ## React Context  is a lot closer to props than it is to state. To me, it's just prop drilling without having to write that code explicitly.
- https://twitter.com/TkDodo/status/1627586506402537473
- That's why it's okay to put data from React Query into context. It's not state syncing. It happens synchronously. The single source of truth remains the Query Cache.
  - It's the same as doing: `<Comp data={data} />` a bunch of times (data coming from useQuery)
- It has the same trade-offs as explicit prop passing compared to calling useQuery again in a deep child:
  - no fine grained subscriptions (select). probably irrelevant for most apps.
  - no refetches on mount events (there is none)
  - component becomes "coupled" to parents
- It also has the same advantages:
  - data cannot be undefined if you've checked for loading / error up top (yay, no ?. needed)
  - no additional observer created (has a non-zero cost). probably irrelevant for most apps.
  - "easier" to test
- Truth to be told.. Loved this thought...context api ia just solving the dependency management problem, but not the state management problem...
  - Absolutely. I wanted to phrase it without "dependency" and "injection"

- ## While I could probably refactor #ReactQuery to use middleware too and get the meat-and-potatoes bundle down to around where SWR is, it would ultimately require users to add a bunch of middleware to get it back to today's 100% functionality, bringing it right back up where it is 
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1433154450600853505
  - Would it be worth it? Meh.
  - To be clear. We are not doing this.
- Where can I see what middleware are for libs like react query (without having to learn and write swr)? The only middleware I know are from redux or from server side (express, fastapi)
  - Middleware usually just describes a user defined function that wraps the original functionality of the caller.
- very interested to see a smaller react query, but the effort can be too much indeed ü•≤
  - i think what i'd like to see is more alternatives flourishing, it gives more control over size vs feature set.
- Glad that you're now thinking of it this way. 
  - There're things that SWR *can* have, but we've decided not to add aggressively (just like your opinion on middleware). 
  - To be clear: supporting middleware doesn't mean SWR will "shift a lot of core features into the user's hands".

- ## React 18 and the future of async data
- https://swizec.com/blog/react-18-and-the-future-of-async-data/
- React 18 is shipping with `<Suspense>` and `startTransition` for deferred component rendering, but not data loading. 
  - To explore that future, I built a side-by-side comparison of current best practice ‚Äì React Query ‚Äì and future `<Suspense>` for data fetching.
- The demo shows a New York Times best seller list.
  - Its name and publication date come from an API call. 
  - The list of books comes from another API call. 
  - You get a cascading spinner effect. Need data from the first call to make the second.
- Suspense coordinates those loading states for you and shows 1 spinner. Nothing renders until everything's ready.
  - But the true benefit is how Suspense simplifies your code.
- Look at the WithoutSuspense branch of my demo. 
  - First you have the low-level data loading. An async helper that calls the fetch() method to load data from an API.
  -  You await the fetch(), then you await the json() parsing, then you return the result or throw an error.
  - Second you have a helper hook that loads your data. You should use React Query or similar for this part.
  - **To avoid re-fetching the same data for every component, libraries like React Query and ApolloGraphQL use an internal global cache**. The shared cache leads to ridiculously snappy UI.
  - Third you have to handle loading states everywhere.
- ¬∑ turns async states into first-class citizens of React. You don't have to think about it. 
  - You'll need React 18.x and a suspense-enabled library like `react-fetch` . The library would rely on suspense `<Cache>` internally.
  - Any component inside `<Suspense>` can say "Halt! Don't render me yet". React waits until every "halt" is resolved to render the children.
  - While components resolve, React shows the fallback.

# discuss-incubating-2020
- React Query is for managing server state, not client-only application state. 
  - For that, feel free to keep using redux or react context.

- about GraphQL
  - A lot of apps are not as graph-like as we imagine
  - Deep querying/transport is handy, but not worth the savings unless you have massive amounts of relationships or truly need deeply relational querying clientside.
  - If that's the case, and waterfall-querying/transport-size becomes a problem, you can easily add relationships and field-masking to a REST api (eg. JSON schema, pre-GQL api, custom) or finally implement GQL (I wager this would never happen for a lot of apps)
  - The benefits of GraphQL are often thought of as native to GQL itself, but most of the benefit felt comes from libraries like Apollo and Relay. I'm more of a believer in these libs (and their architecture) than I am in GQL.
  - Subscriptions in GQL seem to be pretty wild-west still, and fall on the user (or a lib) to implement however they want. Some libs implement them very well, some don't. They also raised questions in me about what exactly subscriptions should be transporting (queries vs events)
  - This is what initially inspired me to build React Query. I loved these tools, but ultimately we didn't go with GQL. I found that the great experience I associated with Apollo and missed had more to do with its opinions and architecture than GQL.

- move to react-query
  1. Stop trying to cache your #react server state in {globalStateLibrary}.
  2. Move it all to React Query
  3. Realize your "global state" is now TINY.
  4. Stop using {overPrescribedGlobalStateLibrary} for that TINY state and just use useState/Reducer/Machine + Context.
- Stop using ‚Äúglobal state‚Äù tools for Server State! 
  - Queries
  - Prefetching 
  - Caching
  - Optimistic Mutations
  - Background Fetching
  - Paginated/Infinite Queries

- So how does react-query solve the issue of global state?
  - It solves it by making you /not need one at all/. 
  - Rather than keep the data in some "store", which is a representation of data from the server anyway...
  - Just keep a cache of the query's response.

- I saw a PR of yours explaining how you're not planning support websockets in RQ.
  - Well, it's not about "support". 
  - It's about integration, which is already there. 
  - You can set up sockets however you'd like (I use pusher, usually), then send events to users to "invalidate" queries on the front-end. 
  - This cuts down on message size and also let's the client be smart
  - Bottom line is that if data is async, I'm storing it in React Query. 
  - My recommendation for CRUD like apps that use sockets is to not transfer objects in the payload, only events. If you have a truly real-time app like chat/game, totally different.
  - So for an app that needs real-time data, I guess the solution could be a custom hook that handles websocket events and invalidates RQ to store the most updated data in cache

- Looking at @tannerlinsley's react-query, it seems nice and useful as well as @zeithq's swr. But, they are both Hooks-oriented. 
  - My journey is to find and create a new Suspense-first API. 
  - react-suspense-fetch is a primitive library and react-suspense-router is built with it.
  - Could there be a non-router based API? How does it look like? That's my recent question.
  - Also, although react-suspense-router is for Render-as-You-Fetch, initial data fetching is Fetch-on-Render. Can it be Fetch-Then-Render? I 
  - Data fetching hooks and suspense oriented apis are definitely not mutually exclusive. Id say they are more related and synergistic than anything. The only missing piece is performing rollled-up prefetching automatically based on route which you‚Äôll def see in the coming months.
  - react-suspense-fetch: 
    - it's still a fetch-as-you-render paradigm, it all just comes down to the mechanisms for discovering the data a route needs. 
    - In this case, you use a separate route.data import which is cool.
    - However, it's still highly opinionated and relies on an up-front routing config being declared and knowable before rendering into a routes component. I can't think of any other ways to do this yet though, so we'll see what happens there.
    - Thanks for the comment! Yeah, this router-base approach requires route config defined in advance. That's something I'd like to tackle. No idea yet. It won't look like ordinary hook based APIs. Not even sure if such APIs are acceptable to developers. Hope to come up with something

- React Query Research question. If you have a `useQuery` instance rendered on the page, and you render another identical `useQuery` instance on the page, would you expect the second instance mounting to trigger a backround refetch? Or just subscribe?
  - https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1232703154854256640

- Is the approach of React Query to forgo(ÊîæÂºÉ) a global state and instead have local states for each component and its children?
  - Not quite. React Query has its own global state internally that is built specifically for handling async resources and handling their caching/defining/invalidation/refetching lifecycles. You use it in your components much like you would local state, but much better for async data
  - I also want to investigate if useMutableSource could make things better for react-query as well.
  - It would probably improve some performance. Right now it just uses a pub sub setstate pattern.

- Lots of what we call "Application State" is actually just a client-side cache of server state. 
  - And just with any cache, invalidation is a hard problem.
  - Interestingly, I don't think many apps really consider this, but it's pretty important.
  - For example, when a user updates some data, most apps I've seen (and built) will make a request to make the update, and when it's successful, they update the state (client-side cache) as well. Sometimes the order is switched in optimistic UIs.
  - In either case, how do you know that the rest of the data you have in your cache is still current? 
  - Maybe another user changed data in another entity (or even a different property of the same entity).
  - In your app, if the application state on the server got updated, how long would it take for the client to have those changes reflected in the UI?
  - (Let's exclude your app's chat feature for this. I'm asking about regular resources here.)
    - on browser refresh
    - on navigation
    - on polling interval
    - other
  - This is why I'm increasingly interested in simpler libraries like react-query which simply invalidate entire queries and rerequest everything on mutations (and even when the user refocuses the app) rather than libraries like Apollo which try to stitch together state changes.
  - It's all trade-offs (consistency/correctness vs resource management). 
  - But I think more apps could be made simpler and provide a better user experience by favoring correctness.
  - https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1228727040238473216

- All apps have two types of state: UI State and Server Cache. 
  - Put all your server cache in react-query 
  - and the rest of your state is pretty simply managed within React state/context.

- Do you have any guidance on how to integrate with websockets for realtime updates? 
  - If you are pushing the entire payload, you can use the `queryCache.setQueryData` to update the entity anywhere it is used in your cache. 
  - If you are pushing notifications (my recommended approach), you use those to trigger refetches for queries that use the entity.
  - IMO unless you are 100% sure that the client needs an asset immediately, then pushing an entire payload to the browser produces a lot of waste. 
  - With a notification and refetch, you ensure that only queries that are in use (or at least recently used) get updated.

- If I throw a new error in the root of the query function, it will get stuck on "status: loading".
  - If I return the error, the status will be "success", and the error object will become the data.
  - Right, because:
  - 1 - By default, react-query will retry a query by default 3 times before actually failing and going into the status === 'error' state.
  - 2. - When you catch an error, the outer function is no longer in a throwing state. A return === success. You should rethrow

- How does it replace redux state management?
  - It replaces the management of *server state/cache*. 
  - So if you are like a majority of app developers, a vast majority of your "global state" is server cache. 
  - Once you put that into React Query, what you're left with is usually a tiny bit of app state that you can manage via React

 

- RQ handles your server state and what‚Äôs left is usually a small bit of auth and actual UI state, both of which require nothing more than useState/Reducer + context. 
  - There are use cases for Recoil and Redux, but they are the exception, not the norm like everyone‚Äôs been taught.

- If you have a slow render, memoize the computation inside of that component.
  - If you still have issues, then split your state/dispatch, then split contexts. 
  - You can go soooo far with just React. 
  - There are so very few (real) cases where I would ever suggest using Recoil or Redux.
  - Even without memoization, this is still fast as long as your renders are fast. 
  - I can rerender every component in a react chart instance with a single context at near 60 FPS. 
  - Unnecessary renders are only a problem if you‚Äôre writing slow components or rendering 10000‚Äôs at once.

- I feel like I need to clarify something that seems to be going around.
  - SWR did not inspire React Query. 
  - RQ was born long before SWR was publicly release or known of.
  - What is more accurate is that they had similar release dates & have influenced each other in positive ways.
  - Competition is good.
- App state is really not that big. Theme, UI state like a sidebar being open. 
  - Then there‚Äôs routing state. 
  - Still all dwarfed usually by server state.
- So, there are no actions with React Query. It's all subscription based. So 99% of the time, if you move data fetching from Redux to React Query, you'll end up deleting ALL of your reducers, actions, selectors, etc for that data.
- I feel like the whole idea of presentational vs container components has fallen by the wayside with hooks. 
  - In the project I work on people just embedding logic and data into any components with hooks.
  - This is a shame, this separation of concerns works so well.
  - For me, "containers" simply got split up. Some stayed as "routes", most became custom hooks. I think the part that people may still be missing is the "custom hooks" part. It's dead simple to do.
  - I didn't like having a container for every single component, now what I do is have a "PageComponent" that has a custom hook - this is entry point and contains all the stateful logic.
  - All of the components below this tree are presentational
- Having a client for your API is great and IMO suggested. 
  - It's a great "separation of concern". 
  - React Query for instance, isn't concerned with *how or where* you get your data from, only that you get it.
  - Think of it this way, a client could be the best place for authentication, type origination, deserialization, REST/GraphQL DSL
  - And in parallel React Query handles caching, timing, stale data lifecycle, garbage collection, invalidation, etc.

- do you have a folder structure with #ReactQuery in mind? or if you can point me to a project that's using it that would be helpful.
  - I just create a custom hook for each query and put it in the hooks directory. Eg. hooks/usePosts.js
  - Does your custom usePost hook also contain mutational functions such as createPost and updatePost? If so, do you return multiple states for the different mutation and query from the same hook?
  - Nope. Those are different hooks. usePost.js, useCreatePost.js, etc.
  - I create a custom hooks for each query and mutations, like Tanner, but I put queries and mutations in two different subfolders, as for a big project you could easily have 50+ of this hooks. So apiHooks/queries and apiHooks/mutations.

- [talk about React Suspense and data fetching](https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1281143594544328707)
  - Lots of talk about React suspense today. I‚Äôm very excited about it.
  - However, I feel like the patterns I‚Äôve seen in #ReactQuery (and friends like SWR) have alone been more transformative for my own dev process and users and have even prepped me for suspense in a lot of ways.
  - The biggest thing that suspense is going to do for me is just one thing: avoiding that flash of loading/placeholder for newly mounted components. Suspense doesn‚Äôt fetch, it doesn‚Äôt codesplit, it doesn‚Äôt preload for you and it doesn‚Äôt cache for you.
  - It‚Äôs really only about smoothing out the experience of moving from state to state without seeing a loading placeholder. And I am all for it! I hate those loading flashes. 
  - But if I‚Äôm being honest, I think caching and prefetching are WAY more important than that UX quirk.
  - The fact that suspense will depend on data loading, prefetching, caching, etc to be used to its fullest potential is the most curious piece of it all. We‚Äôre all waiting for suspense to happen. It will. 
  - But then what? At that point everyone will be reaching for three things:
    1. Automatic code and data splitting.
    2. The ability to prefetch that code and data in a reliable way.
    3. Data caching layer.
  - I‚Äôm working from the bottom up with #ReactQuery. And already getting so many benefits without even thinking about suspense or code splitting. 
  - I‚Äôm also using Next.js from the top down to take care of as much code/data splitting and prefetching when I need it.
  - If it‚Äôs that important, prefetch it earlier! Don‚Äôt need suspense for that.
  - You don‚Äôt need anything more than we have already to start caching, prefetching, code/data splitting, etc.
- When we say ‚ÄúSuspense for data fetching‚Äù we don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúthe Suspense component‚Äù. 
  - That‚Äôs been done over a year ago. We mean an integrated and flexible solution that lets you write code in that paradigm.
  - This solution includes: a way to read data anywhere in the tree, a consistency guarantee (if parent and child both read some data for new ID, you don‚Äôt show old+new mixed up), a cache layer to avoid waterfalls, an invalidation strategy, plus a code splitting integration.
  - You can‚Äôt implement parent/child consistency well without Suspense. `<Parent id>` and `<Child id>` read different data by id and id prop changes. If your solution shows a mix of old and new data while both are refetching, that‚Äôs the problem Suspense *as a paradigm* solves.
  - But Suspense as a paradigm also introduces new problems *because* it solves consistency (without consistency you can ignore them). Such as ‚Äî if you were looking at something, and now it‚Äôs refetching, sometimes it‚Äôs bad to replace already fetched content back with a big spinner.
  - Now this isn‚Äôt some minor UX thing. This is a pretty major expectation for a user that the content they‚Äôre looking at doesn‚Äôt suddenly disappear. Like if you paginate with ‚Äúload more‚Äù you don‚Äôt want existing items to go away.
  - This is why ‚Äúdeclarative and consistent loading states‚Äù were not attempted before. You get the ‚Äúblowing content away‚Äù problem and you can‚Äôt solve it without framework-level support. Concurrent Mode is a solution to that problem. Because it can render next screen ‚Äúin memory‚Äù.
  - So I think stating spinners are a ‚Äúminor thing‚Äù is misleading. If you have declarative loading states and also solve consistency then spinners become a major problem. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt recommend people to use Suspense for data fetching in stable releases. Without CM it sucks.
  - Now if we talk about Suspense+CM then it already works. Relay Hooks works and the whole new website is built on that. People can try. But not everyone is happy with Relay as a solution. So the remaining part is a cache implementation that doesn‚Äôt encourage waterfalls.
  - The waterfall problem is interesting. It‚Äôs a direct consequence of (1) wanting colocation and (2) wanting consistency. If Parent and Child must be consistent, Child can‚Äôt render until Parent is ready ‚Äî means we don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a nested request. This is very slow at scale.
  - Yes, you can get around it by manual prefetching. That also doesn‚Äôt scale. It works for a small app but it doesn‚Äôt work for hundreds or thousands of components, each of which may want to read some data. If we don‚Äôt solve that scale, it doesn‚Äôt count.
  - Relay has a scalable solution. It avoids waterfalls automatically by composing queries at compile time. So the root query always ‚Äúknows‚Äù what children are going to want before their code even loads. But Relay isn‚Äôt for everyone. So we want to build a more generic version.
  - The easiest way to avoid client waterfalls is to move them to the server. Low latency. This is conceptually exactly what GraphQL does, but you don‚Äôt need GraphQL for that. It‚Äôs just a single server endpoint behind which may several different APIs for different components.
  - That also gives you ability to code-split based on *data*. Why load LogedOffNavbar if user is logged in? Why load GifCommentImage when the comment did not include a GIF?
  - If you centralize data fetching on the server then its response can include *code* chunks. Code is data.
  - I just found the framing a little misleading (‚ÄúSuspense is just declarative loading states‚Äù). It‚Äôs more that it‚Äôs everything else that makes this possible without big sacrifices.
  - I‚Äôd also say that consistency between async data in the tree that‚Äôs requested by different components is vastly underappreciated. That‚Äôs the core new benefit of that paradigm but people miss it largely because not much else (except Relay) offers anyting similar today.
  - By visual consistency I mean that you shouldn‚Äôt ever have a situation where A display data from oldId but B displays data from newId. Or the other way around. They should always be consistent with each other as siblings, just like React guarantees for synchronous rendering.
  - In this situation, you are correct. **React Query would potentially show old/new data mixed, depending on raced conditions.**
  - Now imagine hundreds of components. Each doing its own data fetching requirements without coordinating with others at every level. Inconsistencies at that scale would lead to very jumpy UI and crashes from mistaken assumptions (eg some prop from parent didn‚Äôt match child‚Äôs data).
  - I just wanted to be clear *that‚Äôs* the problem we are working to solve. On that scale, consistency isn‚Äôt nice-to-have but it‚Äôs table stakes. Everything breaks down without it.
  - ReactQuery is doing the best it can do but React needs to empower it to be able to do more.
  - I just want the ‚Äúsuspense is a thing to not show a spinner‚Äù meme to die a little bit. That‚Äôs not really what it is.
  - Which, to be fair, is our fault for introducing it this way! Spinners seemed like a catchy way to describe it but it‚Äôs **more about read data anywhere without screwing(ÂºÑÂùèÔºåÂºÑ‰π±) up the UI**.
  - **How many apps don't need anything more than route-level data fetching**?
    - The latest @ReactPodcast about  @remix_run basically came to this conclusion. 
    - But then the "route-y" boys think everything is about routes. (and they're right)
  - But for the ones that do need more and run into the waterfall requests, do you envision most if not all of those apps jumping for Suspense for Data + CM when it's released? Like... is the pain that bad? Clearly it was for FB. But what does your research say for everyone else?
  - Sure! A lot of those apps might not even benefit from React itself much. I think overall `Promise.all` is a good indicator.
  - It‚Äôs not an unavoidable problem. When you run into it you hoist data fetching up. That ends up not being efficient (not the whole child tree has to wait for all data) but hey, it works. There‚Äôs a reason people `Promise.all` over the place.
  - How many React apps have Promise.all?
  - I mean the kinds of apps that fetch all data at route level could often be better written with a Rails-like model. Just a regular old style web app! This is something we also want to make easier to do using React in the future.
  - As I said earlier, the only thing I wanted to clarify is that Suspense is not a thing to avoid ‚Äúspinners‚Äù but something different.

- do you use react query as your source of truth for state or do you hold state in react or elsewhere as well?
  - For 99% of async and server state, React Query is the source of truth. 
  - For anything that truly lives on the client or "app state", I have a tiny useReducer + context.

- 1. Cache space is negligible in most apps. If you are running into cache size issues, you're probably holding on to things too long or not garbage collecting unused cache. A big tradeoff for something that rarely is an issue.
- 2. You can do this with RQ, it's just not automatic, and for good reason. Its often that index/list calls for assets only show a part or summary of the entity, and your single crud calls will show all of it. I realize that this one of the things that fragments are for in GQL.  
  - but at the end of the day, is it really that difficult to just invalidate your queries? Active stuff on the screen refetches (would happen on a refresh anyway) and anything unused would get refetched on next use. Again, a harsh tradeoff with a lot of edge cases IMO
- 3. Bandwidth does have some shallow concern with refetching all the things all the time, but then again, what if your users were to refresh the page? At that point, you would be in the same position needing to refetch all the things anyway. At the end of the day, the tradeoffs just don't seem worth it to me. Even after using Apollo and building my own Redux powered normalized cache, it was all so much work for such tiny and often underutilized ROI.
- There's also a plethora of interesting situations that normalization puts you in. My favorite is when a mutation on a single object inherently changes its position in a list that was generated server-side. You don't know that order, so you can't perform the normalized update.
- To know that order, you would have to know all that the server knows... and that right there is enough to sell me on never using a normalized store for async assets again.
- In most applications, React Query would replace Redux anywhere that you are fetching data from a server (async state). So anywhere you're traditionally using redux-thunk or redux-saga, you'll just use React Query.  For other state that isn't asynchronous, you can keep using redux

- Do you know what the ‚Äúbuilder pattern‚Äù is when referring to Typescript Types?
  - I think the name is leading people in the wrong direction. It‚Äôs more about using function chaining like `registerPlugin(plugin).registerPlugin(...).registerPlugin(...)` to build up complex generics where arrays and reducers are limited.

```JS
can(2020)
  .beTheYear()
  .thatWeStop()
  .making(apis && libraries)
  .thatLookLike(this)?.please;
```

- (or am I the only one who doesn't like overused builder patterns?)  
  - For as much as we talk about making libraries and JS bundle sizes smaller, a lot of you sure love this un-tree-shakeable pattern.
  - I dislike it a lot too! But then I also dislike the "config object" pattern because you can't minify the keys üò≥
  - Curious if there's an alternative xstate API that wouldn't force to give unminifiable names to states themselves. Understand if it's not a priority (I guess prod introspection is useful). But I wonder if other takes on this that use plain variables (for minification) exist.
  - I was a little cheeky, just pointing out the difficulty of visually parsing inside-out: `uppercase(toString(add(mult(2, 3))))`
  Versus left-to-right:
 `mult().add().toString().uppercase`

  - The pipe operator is one way to get the readability, without the builder pattern (fluent api).
  - When working with a team, I prefer this:

```js
const multipledNum = mult(2, 3);
const addedNum = add(multipliedNum, 42);
const stringAddedNum = upperCase(toString(addedNum));
```

  - Clarity > conciseness (plus this minifies well enough)
  - Also, I don't hate the builder pattern/fluent interfaces completely, I just think they're sometimes overused when more idiomatic alternatives can be used.
