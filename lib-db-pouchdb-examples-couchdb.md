  - PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.
  - It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online
  - PouchDB is not a self-contained database; 
    - it is a CouchDB-style abstraction layer over other databases. 
    - PouchDB supports all modern browsers, using IndexedDB under the hood
    - In Node.js, PouchDB uses LevelDB under the hood, and also supports many other backends via the LevelUP ecosystem.
  - The main benefit is to be able to replicate data with any CouchDB compatible endpoint. 
    - Because of the CouchDB compatibility, PouchDB has to do a lot of overhead in handling the revision tree of document, which is why it can show bad performance for bigger datasets.
    - RxDB was originally build around PouchDB until the storage layer was abstracted out in version 10.0.0(202107)
    - PouchDB has some performance issues because of how it has to store the document revision tree to stay compatible with the CouchDB API.

  - PouchDB Server can run fully in-memory (no changes are saved)
    - Or it can run using SQLite rather than LevelDB
  - üßê It is modeled after the single-node design of CouchDB 1.x, although it contains some CouchDB 2.x features such as Mango queries.
  - PouchDB Server is much less battle-tested than CouchDB, but it does pass the full PouchDB test suite.
  - PouchDB Server is a standalone REST server that implements the CouchDB API, while using a LevelDB-based PouchDB under the hood. It also supports an --in-memory mode and any LevelDOWN adapter

  - Conflict-free collaborative editing for PouchDB
  - A PouchDB plugin for partial updates that uses the **every-doc-is-a-delta** storage pattern. 
  - You can use delta pouch to enable conflict-free collaborative editing of the same docs.
  - Delta pouch stores every change as a doc.
  - [Question: a helpful link describing the "every-doc-is-a-delta storage pattern"?](https://github.com/redgeoff/delta-pouch/issues/53)
    - Sounds like "every-doc-is-a-delta" is another way of saying "log database". Is that right?
    - I would look up anything related to "Event Sourcing" which perhaps is a superset of this idea. Basically, the idea is that you save the events that happen in your system and then compile those into views.

- pouchdb-sync-to-anything /43Star/MIT/201807/js
  - https://github.com/karlwestin/pouchdb-sync-to-anything
  - This is a plugin that lets you use CouchDBs replication algorithm with checkpointing, resuming, etc, but provide your own function to write the documents. 
  - This can be used to sequentially write updates to a REST API, 
  - üëâüèª This is a partial implementation of the CouchDB replication protocol. 
    - It allows you to use PouchDB's tools to save replication checkpoints for syncing with your API. 
    - Using those checkpoints, we can start the next replication from the last good checkpoint.
  - Using this works best for one way data-flows only. If you're interested in a 2-way data flow, consider syncing data from the server to a different PouchDB instance, and write changes that are to be sent to the server separately.

- https://github.com/mikeal/couchup /201307/js
  - A CouchDB implementation on top of levelup.
  - The goal is to build a data model well suited for mobile applications that may need to work offline and sync later on and maintain smart client side caches. 
  - The goal is to build a data model well suited for mobile applications that may need to work offline and sync later on and maintain smart client side caches. 
  - This data model is inspired by CouchDB but diverges greatly in the way it handles and resolves the revision history and conflicts. 
  - couchup implements a "most writes wins" conflict resolution scheme and does not require or even allow user specific conflict resolution.
  - modular. This repository only implements the base document storage layer. Indexes, attachments and replicators are implemented as additional modules
  - The tradeoffs couchup has made in revision tree storage along with some other simple optimizations mean that couchup already has better write performance than CouchDB and the same consistency guarantees.

- https://github.com/nlfiedler/mokuroku /apache2/202309/rust/rocksdb
  - Secondary indices for RocksDB in Rust.
  - designed to provide a secondary index on top of the RocksDB key/value store, similar to what PouchDB does for LevelDB.
  - Your application will provide implementations of the `Document` trait to suit the various types of data to be stored in the database, and this library will invoke the mapping function on those Document instances to produce index key/value pairs.
  - The behavior of this library is similar to PouchDB, albeit(ËôΩÁÑ∂ÔºõÂ∞ΩÁÆ°) with an API suitable for the language. 
  - Unlike PouchDB, this library does not put any constraints on the format of the database records.
  - You may see the term `view` used here and there. This is what CouchDB and PouchDB call the indices in their documentation. 
    - The function name `emit` also comes from the `map/reduce` API of CouchDB, and makes as much sense as anything else.
  - What this library does exactly: the indices managed by this library are "stand-alone", meaning they are not embedded within the database files (e.g. zone maps or bloom filters). Additionally, the index is updated in a lazy fashion

  - PostDB is proof-of-concept database that exposes a Apache CouchDB-like API but which is backed by a SQLite database.

  - It does not implement CouchDB's MVCC, Design Documents, attachments, MapReduce, "Mango" search or any other CouchDB feature.
  - It does however provide a "consistent" data store where the documents and secondary indexes are in lock-step. Documents are limited to 100KB in size.
  - Optionally, PostDB nodes can be run in readonly mode and configured to read data from PostgreSQL read replicas to scale out read performance.

  - Stores all data as a series of deltas, which allows for smooth collaborative experiences even in frequently offline scenarios.
  - I have decided to suspend development of DeltaDB for the following reasons:
    - last-write-wins policy is nice when starting a new project as it is automatic, but other conflict resolution policies that force the user to manually resolve the conflict, like CouchDB‚Äôs revision protocol, have become more of the standard in the offline-first world.
    - Building a DB that scales and is Building a DB that scales and is distributed over many nodes, takes a lot of work.
