  - PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser.
  - It enables applications to store data locally while offline, then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online
  - PouchDB is not a self-contained database; 
    - it is a CouchDB-style abstraction layer over other databases. 
    - PouchDB supports all modern browsers, using IndexedDB under the hood
    - In Node.js, PouchDB uses LevelDB under the hood, and also supports many other backends via the LevelUP ecosystem.
  - The main benefit is to be able to replicate data with any CouchDB compatible endpoint. 
    - Because of the CouchDB compatibility, PouchDB has to do a lot of overhead in handling the revision tree of document, which is why it can show bad performance for bigger datasets.
    - RxDB was originally build around PouchDB until the storage layer was abstracted out in version 10.0.0(202107)
    - PouchDB has some performance issues because of how it has to store the document revision tree to stay compatible with the CouchDB API.

  - Delta pouch stores every change as a doc.
  - [Question: a helpful link describing the "every-doc-is-a-delta storage pattern"?](https://github.com/redgeoff/delta-pouch/issues/53)
    - Sounds like "every-doc-is-a-delta" is another way of saying "log database". Is that right?
    - I would look up anything related to "Event Sourcing" which perhaps is a superset of this idea. Basically, the idea is that you save the events that happen in your system and then compile those into views.

  - [How Hoodie Works](https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie/blob/master/docs/about/how-hoodie-works.rst)
  - The Offline First JavaScript Backend
  - hoodie can be used standalone or as a hapi plugin. 
  - Hoodie is using `PouchDB` for its in-browser storage.
  - Hoodie uses PouchDB for storing data locally. Hoodie saves all data here first, before doing anything else.
  - Hoodie relies on CouchDB. We use it to sync data back and forth between the server and the clients
  - So Hoodie does `client ‚Üî database ‚Üî server` instead of the traditional `client ‚Üî server ‚Üî database`, and this is where many of its superpowers come from.

  - The goal is to build a data model well suited for mobile applications that may need to work offline and sync later on and maintain smart client side caches. 
  - This data model is inspired by CouchDB but diverges greatly in the way it handles and resolves the revision history and conflicts. 
  - couchup implements a "most writes wins" conflict resolution scheme and does not require or even allow user specific conflict resolution.
  - modular. This repository only implements the base document storage layer. Indexes, attachments and replicators are implemented as additional modules
  - The tradeoffs couchup has made in revision tree storage along with some other simple optimizations mean that couchup already has better write performance than CouchDB and the same consistency guarantees.

  - Build your own modern CouchDB with Rust
  - I want "real time" replication to IndexedDB, which is unpleasant with regular CouchDB. The unpleasantness is mainly due to the revision mechanism, which is fairly Erlang specific. Revisions hashes are calculated using Erlang data structures and md5, both which are not native in browsers. Of course it is possible to achieve the revision calculation with some extra libraries. Still, I think it will be a fun challenge to implement a modern CouchDB variant

  - [Branch support](https://github.com/khonsulabs/nebari/issues/29)
    - For BonsaiDb we plan on supporting the replication logic at the BonsaiDb level, and we are hoping to support bi-directional replication with customizable conflict resolution. 
    - This is a form of branching, because you can clone a database using replication, modify it, and then eventually replicate again in either direction.
  - [Project Status_202301](https://github.com/khonsulabs/bonsaidb/issues/262)
    - One serious thought I still have is whether Nebari should exist, or whether BonsaiDb should just use another database format. 
    - BonsaiDb/CouchDB were designed with the idea of being able to embed extra information inside of the B+Tree structures. This is how the map/reduce is powered -- the reduced values can be stored directly in the B+Tree so that a reduce query doesn't need to visit all of the nodes in the tree to come up with an aggregate result. From what I could find, no other database engine that is written in Rust supports embedding extra information inside of the B+Tree structure itself, while it's a key-feature of Nebari.
    - Nearly every other embedded database engine does not utilize a write-ahead log. In my testing, a write-ahead log is absolutely critical for insert performance.

- https://github.com/nlfiedler/mokuroku /apache2/202309/rust/rocksdb
  - Secondary indices for RocksDB in Rust.
  - designed to provide a secondary index on top of the RocksDB key/value store, similar to what PouchDB does for LevelDB.
  - Your application will provide implementations of the `Document` trait to suit the various types of data to be stored in the database, and this library will invoke the mapping function on those Document instances to produce index key/value pairs.
  - The behavior of this library is similar to PouchDB, albeit(ËôΩÁÑ∂ÔºõÂ∞ΩÁÆ°) with an API suitable for the language. 
  - Unlike PouchDB, this library does not put any constraints on the format of the database records.
  - You may see the term `view` used here and there. This is what CouchDB and PouchDB call the indices in their documentation. 
    - The function name `emit` also comes from the `map/reduce` API of CouchDB, and makes as much sense as anything else.
  - What this library does exactly: the indices managed by this library are "stand-alone", meaning they are not embedded within the database files (e.g. zone maps or bloom filters). Additionally, the index is updated in a lazy fashion

- pouchdb-sync-to-anything /43Star/MIT/201807/js
  - https://github.com/karlwestin/pouchdb-sync-to-anything
  - This is a plugin that lets you use CouchDBs replication algorithm with checkpointing, resuming, etc, but provide your own function to write the documents. 
  - This can be used to sequentially write updates to a REST API, 
  - üëâüèª This is a partial implementation of the CouchDB replication protocol. 
    - It allows you to use PouchDB's tools to save replication checkpoints for syncing with your API. 
    - Using those checkpoints, we can start the next replication from the last good checkpoint.
  - Using this works best for one way data-flows only. If you're interested in a 2-way data flow, consider syncing data from the server to a different PouchDB instance, and write changes that are to be sent to the server separately.

    - There is no per-document rights, only per-DB. A common recommendation around this is to use many (think thousands) of DBs, i.e. DB-per-user, and set up filtered replications to maintain each user's access. Unfortunately this has very poor performance
    - Couchbase, does a much better job of security and rights, though has its own quirks. It requires a secondary layer (called Sync Gateway) to give it a Couch-like API which can connect to PouchDB

- https://github.com/jurassix/redux-pouchdb-store-enhancer /201611/js
  - to store actions locally, sync with remote CouchDB, and time travel by applying remote actions locally and then compute distributed nextState.
  - Every action that a single client emits as part of the regular Redux architecture will be intercepted and pushed into a local PouchDB database.
  - All local PouchDB actions are sync'd to a remote CouchDB database. 
  - All actions are added to the DB in accountant style, where every record is additive, and conflicts are almost guaranteed to be nonexistent.
  - Actions ordering is guaranteed to be deterministic by using a PouchDB `_id` that is a composite of `TIMESTAMP-UUIDv4`.
  - [Performance with large number of stored events](https://github.com/jurassix/redux-pouchdb-store-enhancer/issues/2)
    - I love idea of automatic state syncing, and generating new state based on saved events. 
    - However, I've made some benchmarks and find out that the most time-consuming part of loading state is getting all stored actions from local PouchDB instance.
    - this test shows main bottleneck of loading all store events from PouchDB. We need to figure out some way to efficiently load inital state
    - My plan to prevent this issue was to consolidate actions into a single action given a threshold. When to do this is the hard part
    - Maybe if we chunked the batching we could mitigate some of the time traveling conflicts. So instead of condensing all actions at a threshold we could just condense partitions of the actions.
    - I have thought about moving the reducer to the server too.
