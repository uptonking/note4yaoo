- ## Excel formula language: The most used programming language in the world!

  - Before you read on. If you don’t think of spreadsheets as programs. Read [Spreadsheets are programs](https://medium.grid.is/spreadsheets-are-programs-d3a6b0bd214)
  - [Spreadsheets and low-code— it’s the grid, not the syntax__202108](https://medium.grid.is/spreadsheets-and-low-code-its-the-grid-not-the-syntax-cf06935c0983)
- The syntax and conventions in today’s spreadsheet formulas bear a lot of resemblance to the syntax, invented by @DanB and introduced with VisiCalc in 1979. But it is not the *same* language.
- From VisiCalc to Lotus 1-2-3 to Excel to Google Sheets, no new spreadsheet software has been successful without users being able to use their existing spreadsheet files and know-how in the new software.
  - However, each generation has *added* capabilities.
- Microsoft probably learned a lesson from their relatively unsuccessful rival to Lotus 1-2-3 - Multiplan - which tried to introduce significantly different syntax, including the R1C1 reference style instead of A1.
- when releasing Excel, Microsoft ensured backwards compatibility (and familiarity) with Lotus 1-2-3. However, they evolved the syntax. Excel introduced the = to signify a formula.
  - And - with less constraints on memory - defaulted to longer and more legible function names (such as AVERAGE instead of AVG).
- Excel became so dominant, and PCs in general so ubiquitous in Excel's prime years, that when Google Sheets came around, they stuck to the Excel formula syntax to the letter.
  - @googlesheets added some custom functions and features, but they go to great lengths to ensure that the syntax, and even some of the idiosyncrasies of Excel's formulas work exactly the same way in GSheets as they do in Excel
- And this is why the language we use to write our spreadsheet formulas today should rightfully be called "Excel formula language". 
  - It was introduced by @msexcel , has been imitated by others since and will for the foreseeable future.
- However, the power of the world’s most used programming environment doesn’t lie in the syntax, but in the 2D-grid of the sheet. But that's another story

- ## What are macros?
- https://twitter.com/benlcollins/status/1384114620583989257
  - Macros are small programs you create inside of Google Sheets without needing to write any code.
  - They let you automate tasks by recording your actions as you do something and saving these actions as a “recipe” that you can use again with a single click.
