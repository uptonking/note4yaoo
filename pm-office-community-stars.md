- ## [Why did OpenDoc fail, and then fail 3 more times? | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27106195)
- I think the big reason OpenDoc failed is because it was completely steamrolled(以权势和影响力 强迫，迫使; 强行) by Microsoft OLE 2.
- These are complicated enough APIs that a developer is typically going to only implement one.
- This was the early 90's, and Microsoft Windows was the dominant OS. 
  - In addition, Microsoft Office was also becoming the dominant office software.
  - Microsoft put a lot of it's energy behind OLE 2. 
  - Office supported it. 
  - If you wanted your application to be certified for Windows 95, you needed to support OLE 2. 
  - OLE 2 was pushed at all the Microsoft Developer conferences. 
  - Microsoft's Visual C++ MFC framework supported OLE 2
  - Thus if you supported OLE 2, you had a ton of documentation, tooling, libraries, dev environments that supported it.
- On the other hand you had OpenDoc, which did not have nearly as big of a market. 
  - It was not the priority for any of the companies pushing it. 
  - Unlike with Microsoft Office and OLE 2, there wasn't a halo product that showed off the user benefits of OpenDoc. 
  - There wasn't nearly the documentation and tooling and libraries for OpenDoc.
