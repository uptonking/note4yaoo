- ref
  - https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md       
  - https://reactjs.org/versions      

- 16.13.0-20200226
  - In Strict Development Mode, React calls lifecycle methods twice to flush out any possible unwanted side effects. 
    - This release adds that behaviour to shouldComponentUpdate
  - Warnings for some deprecated string refs
  - Deprecate React.createFactory()
- 16.9.0-20190808
  - Performance Measurements with `<React.Profiler>`
  - Async `act()` for Testing
  - warning for using componentWill Mount/ReceiveProps/Update
  - URLs starting with `javascript:` are a dangerous attack surface because it’s easy to accidentally include unsanitized output in a tag like `<a href>` and create a security hole
  - Before compiling JavaScript classes with Babel became popular, React had support for a “factory” component that returns an object with a render method
- 16.8.0-20190206
  - Add **Hooks**
- 16.7.0-20181219
  - 废除componentWillMount，componentWillUpdate，componentWillReceiveProps
  - 关于提早发送数据请求，官方鼓励将数据请求部分的代码放在组件的constructor()中，将现有componentWillMount中的代码迁移至componentDidMount即可
  - new: getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()与componentDidUpdate()一起使用可以取代componentWillUpdate
  - new: getDerivedStateFromProps()与componentDidUpdate()一起使用可以取代componentWillReceiveProps    
  - Clear fields on unmount to avoid memory leaks.  
  - Post to MessageChannel instead of window.   
- 16.6.0-20181023
  - use the **Suspense component to do code-splitting** by wrapping a dynamic import in a call to React.lazy().
  - Add React.memo() as an alternative to PureComponent for functions.
    - PureComponent要依靠class才能使用，而React.memo()可以和functional component一起使用
  - React. StrictMode now warns about legacy context API, findDOMNode.
  - Rename unstable_Placeholder to Suspense, and delayMs to maxDuration.
  - Add contextType as a more ergonomic way to subscribe to context from a class.
- 16.5.0-20180905
  - Add a warning if React.forwardRef render function doesn't take exactly two arguments 
  - Add support for React DevTools Profiler 
  - Minimally support iframes (nested browsing contexts) in selection event handling
- 16.4.0-20180523
  - Add a new experimental React.unstable_Profiler component for measuring performance.
  - Add support for the Pointer Events specification. 
  - Add the ability to specify propTypes on a context provider component.
  - You can now assign propTypes to components returned by React. ForwardRef.
- 16.3.0-20180329
  - **new Context API**：父组件向嵌套内层子组件传递props
  - React.createRef()：在编码中提前声明需要获取 Ref，as an ergonomic alternative to callback refs.
  - React.forwardRef()：let components forward their refs to a child. 用于高阶组件传递ref，使包裹的无状态组件可以接收ref作为第二个参数，并且可以传递下去
  - Add a new getDerivedStateFromProps() lifecycle
  - Add a new getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() lifecycle.
  - Add a new <React. StrictMode> wrapper to help prepare apps for async rendering. 
  - StrictMode：用于在开发环境下提醒组件内使用不推荐写法和即将废弃的API，不会被渲染成真实DOM
  - Add support for onLoad and onError events on the `<link>` tag. 
  - Prevent an infinite loop when attempting to render portals with SSR.
  - Improve user timing API messages for profiling.
- 16.2.0-20171128
  - Add Fragment as named export to React: Fragment可以让聚合一个子元素列表，并且不在DOM中增加额外节点。
  - Support experimental Call/Return types in React. Children utilities.
- 16.1.0-20171109
  - Add support for portals in React. Children utilities.
  - Move link in the warning message to avoid redirect.
  - Include the autoFocus attribute into SSR markup.
  - Support string values for the capture attribute.
- 16.0.0-20170926
  - React Fiber：使得大量的计算可以被拆解分片、异步化
  - Components can now return arrays and strings from render.
  - Improved error handling with introduction of "error boundaries"：componentDidCatch()捕获render()时的错误
  - ReactDOM.createPortal()： support for declaratively rendering a subtree into another DOM node. 解决modal不需要渲染到parent node的问题
  - Streaming mode for server side rendering is enabled with ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream()
  - React DOM now allows passing non-standard attributes.
  - ReactDOM.render() now return null if called from inside a lifecycle method.
  - Calling setState with null no longer triggers an update.
  - Calling setState directly in render always causes an update. Regardless, you should not be calling setState from render.
  - setState callback (second argument) now fires immediately after componentDidMount / componentDidUpdate instead of after all components have rendered.
  - When replacing `<A />` with `<B />` , B.componentWillMount now always happens before A.componentWillUnmount.
  - Shallow renderer no longer calls componentDidUpdate() because DOM refs are not available. 
  - The server renderer has been completely rewritten
  - When "unknown" props are passed to DOM components, for valid values, React will now render them in the DOM. 
  - Errors in the render and lifecycle methods now unmount the component tree by default. To prevent this, add error boundaries.
  - React.createClass, React. PropTypes, React. DOM have been removed from the core package. 
- 15.6.2-20170925
  - Switch from BSD + Patents to MIT license
  - Prevent event handlers from receiving extra argument in development.
  - Add support for controlList attribute to DOM property whitelist 
- 15.6.0-20170613
  - Add support for CSS variables in style attribute
  - Add support for CSS Grid style properties.
- 15.5.0-20170407
  - Added react-dom/test-utils, which exports the React Test Utils.
- 15.4.0-20161116
  - Improved development performance by freezing children instead of copying.
  - The unstable batchedUpdates API now passes the wrapped function's return value through.
- 15.3.0-20160729
  - Add `React.PureComponent`
  - Add xmlns, xmlnsXlink to supported SVG attributes. 
- 15.2.0-20160701
  - Stop validating props at mount time, only validate at element creation. 
  - Add warning for unknown properties on DOM elements. 
- 15.1.0-20160520
  - Add a new warning to communicate that props objects passed to createElement must be plain objects. 
  - Add additional information to the controlled input warning.
- 15.0.0-20160407
  - Initial render now uses document.createElement instead of generating HTML. 
  - No more extra <span>s. ReactDOM will now render plain text nodes interspersed with comment nodes that are used for demarcation.
  - Rendering null now uses comment nodes. Previously null would render to `<noscript>` elements. We now use comment nodes. 
  - Functional components can now return null.
  - All SVG tags are now fully supported.   
- 0.14.0-20151007
  - Split the main react package into two: react and react-dom
  - Stateless functional components：使用js函数直接定义react组件
  - Refs to DOM components as the DOM node itself.  
    - Note that refs to custom (user-defined) components work exactly as before; 
    - only the built-in DOM components are affected by this change.
  - The props object is now frozen, so mutating props after creating a component element is no longer supported.
  - Plain objects are no longer supported as React children; arrays should be used instead.
  - setProps and replaceProps are now deprecated. 
  - Added React. Children.toArray
- 0.13.0-20150310
  - Calls to setState in life-cycle methods are now always batched and therefore asynchronous.

  - The findDOMNode method has moved from react module to the react-dom module.
  - Added a new top-level API React.cloneElement(el, props)
  - New ref style, allowing a callback to be used in place of  string
  - this.setState() can now take a function as the first argument for transactional state updates, 
    - such as this.setState((state, props) => ({count: state.count + 1}));
- 0.12.0-20141028
  - key and ref moved off props object, now accessible on the element directly
