# lib-toolkit-layer-reactjs-popup

# guide

- modal不依赖trigger，tooltip和menu依赖trigger
  - It's important to mention that the controlled popup works for modal only 
  - and I think it does not make sense to use a controlled popup for tooltip and menu because we need the trigger element to calculate popup position.
