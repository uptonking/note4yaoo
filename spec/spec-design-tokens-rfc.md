## Adobe DSP

- ref
  - https://github.com/AdobeXD/design-system-package-dsp
  - https://github.com/demianborba/spectrum-dsp

- DSP is a new open-format folder-structure created to help teams share design system information across tools.
- A Design System Package (DSP) is a folder containing subfolders with assets and JSON files that represent design system information:
- dsp.json
  - This is the entry point for the Design System Package (DSP). It includes package info, settings, and imports.
- /assets
  - contains all the static assets included in the DSP, such as SVG or PNG files.
- /data
  - contains all of the data that comprises the DSP format. 
  - The folder has no required files. 
  - File examples are components.json, docs.json, fonts.json and tokens.json.
- /dist
  - contains platform-specific code generated by a build system
  - vscode extension has Style Dictionary as its build system. 
  - Examples of folders created by a build system are /android, /css and /styledictionary. 
  - Dist also contains non-platform-specific code such as the Style Dictionary input files and folders (config and properties).
- /ext
  - hold files written by third party tools.
  - Its subfolders must follow the reverse domain name convention of "com_partner_name"

# DTCG(Design Tokens Community Group)

- Design tokens are indivisible pieces of a design system such as colors, spacing, typography scale.
- The DTCG’s goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale.

- https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group
  - https://twitter.com/DesignTokens
  - https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/tree/example-token-files
    - 官网的例子基于theo实现
  - The DTCG was founded in June 2019. 
  - 松散的组织很难统一制定标准和推广标准，从19年到21年连个文档都没写出来
  - 更推荐参考大公司和知名项目的选择，如amazon的style-dictionary

- 主流tokens工具及标准参考

  - salesforce-theo-spec

## [[RFC] Format specification](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/issues/1)

- Principles
  - For core properties (name, value, description…), a design token file must be both human-editable and human-readable
  - The format is simple, extensible, and as unopinionated as possible
  - Vendors (design system tools, design tools…) can store information for their own usage, both globally and for each token
  - The format translates well to existing design tools, in order to facilitate adoption

``` typescript
interface TokenList {
  // Where tokens are stored (in an array)
  tokens: Token[];
  // is this useful? should it be optional or not?
  version?: string;

  // Optional metadata
  data?: Data;

  // What other global properties are needed? (type, category, group…)
}

interface Token {
  name: string;
  value: any;
  description?: string;
  data?: Data;
  // What other properties are needed? (type, category, group…)
}

interface Data {
  // Vendor-prefixed data
  // for example: `data: { vendor: { "@sketch": {} } }`
  vendor?: object;

  // Any number of additional properties can live here,
  // for example, for storing additional information related to the token
}

```

``` JSON
{
  tokens: [
    {
      name: 'Foo',
      value: 'Bar'
    },
    {
      name: 'I am a token',
      value: 'This is a value',
      description: 'A nice description.',
      data: {
        myOwnFlag: true,
        oneMoreThing: 'yay'
        vendor: {
          '@sketch': {
          },
          '@figma': {
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  data: {
    vendor: {
      '@sketch': {
      },
      '@figma': {
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## [[RFC] Theming](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/issues/2)

- Here's a rough draft that essentially mimics how the CSS cascade works

``` js
// Defaults
[
  { name: 'tokenA', value: 'foo' },
  { name: 'tokenB', value: 'bar' },
]

// Overrides for dark mode, loaded subsequently
[
  { name: 'tokenA', value: 'baz' },
]

// Should resolve to:
[
  { name: 'tokenA', value: 'baz' },
  { name: 'tokenB', value: 'bar' },
]
```

## [Design Tokens Community Group Charter](https://github.com/design-tokens/community-group/blob/master/CHARTER.md)

- Scope of Work
  - Enabling sharing color palettes or themes between multiple design tools
  - Allowing design system tooling to share a common language with other parts of the design process
  - Lowering the bar for design and development teams to deploy design tokens in their workflows

- Out of Scope
  - TBD: Identify topics known in advance to be out of scope

- Specifications
  - format, grammar, syntax
  - color
  - spacing
  - durations
  - typography
  - any other design token-related specifications

# Open UI

- open ui相对于dtcg的特点
  - 重点是通用ui组件的样式与交互规范，而dtcg重点是通用样式变量
  - 重点是帮助开发者和设计师互操作，而dtcg重点是各类设计工具的互操作

- The web deserves interoperability between component frameworks and design systems.
  - The UI community should standardize namings and structures for common components. 
  - We should also standardize a way of theming these components. 
  - We should set a path for existing solutions to converge and for browsers to natively provide these things in the future.

- https://github.com/WICG/open-ui
  - https://open-ui.org/components/button
- https://wicg.io/
  - to define the next generation of web technologies.

## [Web Incubator Community Group Charter](https://wicg.github.io/admin/charter.html)

- These are the goals Open UI believes will realize the above vision.
  - Document component names as they exist today
  - A common language for describing UIs and design systems
  - Browser standards for web app components

- Scope of work
  - Utilize descriptivism of common patterns to identify and standardize on:
    - Component names and parts
    - States
    - Behaviors
    - How behaviors transition state (eg: keyboard or pointer interaction)
  - The necessary accessibility requirements (this is not in place of WAI-ARIA or WCAG but linking where appropriate to alleviate implementor pain)
  - Upon discovery of gaps in the web platform, denote those and raise relevant issues to standards bodies
  - Design system terminology

- Out of scope
  - Standardization of appearance of the component

- https://github.com/malerba118/react-handoff
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/async-night-7kyrq?file=/src/App.tsx
  - 依赖chakra-ui, emotion
  - aimed to turn any react app into a visual editor where you can visually tweak and persist props from the browser.
  - enables designers and developers to work in parallel
  - 修改后组件的配置可以导出为json，而组件的默认值从json初始化

- [Component and token naming in Design Systems](https://medium.com/@NateBaldwin/component-and-token-naming-in-design-systems-366bad54843f)
- It’s perfectly fine for all of these unique class names to exist in a design system’s component ecosystem:
  - QuickActions, quickActions, quick-actions
  - “Wait, how do we know whether to use the QuickActions, quickActions, or the quick-actions?”
  - Nobody, ever
- What is problematic is when each library gives the same component a different name. 
    - For instance, if one team decided the Quick Actions component should be called Action Buttons.
- Another point to mention is that your component libraries are not necessarily going to be the very first to deliver a reusable set of components to your engineering team
  - In order to differentiate between components, a rationale solution is to prefix all component names, such as myDSButton.
- Summary
  - There’s no hard-and-fast rules or best practices for a single, system-wide naming convention or standard. 
  - What’s important is the various resources of your system are consistent in spirit
  - 没有统一标准，那就参考大公司或主流项目的规则

- [Design Tokens: How to use them effectively](https://uxdesign.cc/design-tokens-how-to-use-them-effectively-d495ff05cbbf)
- Types of Design Tokens
  - Global Token
  - Alias Token
  - Component-specific token
- We here pulled data from the Figma API. 
  - what we did was placed our base.json file created into our src.
  -  Styled Dictionary will help us to convert our token data which are base colors, typography, spaces, box shadow etc. in a single JSON file to design tokens.
- DT are the central source of truth for our tiny UI information to store
