- ## 7 UI Tips for beautiful & usable card designs

  - 每条技巧都有图片说明正确与错误用例
1. Adjust Inner Element Border Radius
  - Avoid using the same border radius for both the card and the inner elements
  - A rule of thumb is to use for the inner border-radius half the size of the outer element
2. Highlight Your Main CTA
  - A common mistake is to use too many primary CTA
  - You need to force users to take a single action & don't confuse them 
  - Have a single primary CTA in your card
3. Use Smooth Shadows
  - Avoid too strong shadows to show elevation. Make them feel natural and smoother
  - Tip: Make the shadows stronger/bigger on hover to add a nice animation effect
4. Avoid Too Long Content
  - Include only the necessary information on your card preview
  - Too long content (or too much) confuses the user. Especially if you display multiple cards in a grid
5. Left Align Text
  - Many times we center text to make our UI look symmetric.
  - However, it's a fact that left-aligned text is far more readable, and allows your user to scan the card easier.
6. Increase Whitespace
  - Whitespace lets elements 'breath'. Be generous with space around & between element 
  - A rule of thumb is to use the same space value for the padding around the card and the space between elements
7. Elevation Effects Can Be Tricky
  - When you add "shadows over shadows" avoid using the exact same shadow. 
  - I advise you to use a small shadow for the card and a larger one for the element on top of the card. 
  - In that way, the button looks like it's a layer on top of the card.
