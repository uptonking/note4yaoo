## react component vs element vs instance
- ref
  - [React Components, Elements, and Instances](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html)
- An element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties. 
  - It contains only information about the component type (for example, a Button), its properties (for example, its color), and any child elements inside it.
  - It is a way to tell React what you want to see on the screen. 
  - You can’t call any methods on the element.
  - It’s just an immutable description object with two fields: `type: (string | ReactClass)` and `props: Object`
  - An element is a plain object describing what you want to appear on the screen in terms of the DOM nodes or other components.
  - Elements can contain other elements in their props. 
  - Creating a React element is cheap. 
  - Once an element is created, it is never mutated.
- A React component takes props as an input, and returns an element tree as the output.
  - A component can be declared in several different ways. class/func
  - props flows one way in React: from parents to children.
- An instance is what you refer to as `this` in the component class you write. 
  - It is useful for storing local state and reacting to the lifecycle events.
  - Only components declared as classes have instances, and you never create them directly: React does that for you
  - While mechanisms for a parent component instance to access a child component instance exist, they are only used for imperative actions (such as setting focus on a field), and should generally be avoided.
  - React takes care of creating an instance for every class component, so you can write components in an object-oriented way with methods and local state, but other than that, instances are not very important in the React’s programming model and are managed by React itself.
  - Function components don’t have instances at all.
