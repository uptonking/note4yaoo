  - Should allow us to provide a "coding agent" similar to smolagents, except properly sandboxed and therefore safe.

- smolagents has code execution in @e2b sandboxes

- What makes smolagents code execution not properly sandboxed and safe?
  - from what I understand they try to provide security through limiting imports. I'm pretty confident that won't be fully safe against untrusted code.
