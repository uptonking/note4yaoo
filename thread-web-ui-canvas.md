- You might also consider something like https://pixijs.com which offers all of this stuff out of the box on a OpenGL accelerated "canvas".
  - Does Pixi have its own zoom UI system? Last time I used it it did not (though I loved Pixi for other reasons). Two.js does ship with some started zoom ui code though
