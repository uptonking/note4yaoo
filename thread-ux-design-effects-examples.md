- But never at the expense of higher-priority requests/bugs. 
  - I remember using a system that had a backlog of bugs but added falling snow to the UI around the winter holidays. 
  - It was infuriating to see dedicated effort towards that at the expense of what was needed at the time.

- ## Liquid Swipe - “Can it be done in React Native?”
- https://twitter.com/wcandillon/status/1407354859209244685
  - The intro was coded in React using Remotion
- Amazing intro, man. Even more so after knowing that's made with Remotion.
- Love the intro, Look clean and professional
  - Maybe even better with some subtle code snippets in the background.
  - That way the audiences' expectation would be perfectly set to "crafting design with code"

- ## Mesmerization. Made with code in Remotion

- ## Really happy with how the coded version of this Pricing Page design by @jamesm turned out for an upcoming Tailwind UI update
- https://twitter.com/david_luhr/status/1390407355733577735
  - Lots of interesting semantic markup and responsive design considerations for the pricing tiers and feature comparison sections.
  - 屏幕由宽变窄时ui变化的过程
- Many feature comparison sections in the wild aren't actually accessible. 
  - To do thing properly, we use a well-structured `<table>` on larger screens and a `<dl>` (definition list) on smaller screens to present this dense content in a semantic way.
- Another detail: in the feature comparison, the "cards" are faked to work around `<table>` and `<dl>` limitations. 
  - Semantics always come first. 
  - They're backgrounds, followed by the content, followed by borders, which scale with the content, all hidden from the accessibility tree.
