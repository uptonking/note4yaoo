  - Multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks
  - Project Jupyter created JupyterHub to support many users
  - multi-user Hub (tornado process)
  - Hub handles login and spawns single-user servers on demand
  - With JupyterHub you can create a multi-user Hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server.

    - https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/
    - https://mybinder.org/
    - Turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks
    - BinderHub is built with Python, kubernetes, tornado, npm, webpack, and sphinx.
    - A JupyterHub server will host your repository's contents. We offer you a reusable link and badge to your live repository that you can easily share with others.

  - https://jupyter-server.github.io/jupyverse
  - A Jupyter server based on FastAPI
  - A set of Asphalt components implementing a Jupyter server.
  - 202207: Jupyverse and FPS generally embrace modern Python technologies such as ASGI, and an ecosystem built around uvicorn/Starlette/FastAPI, which we see as the future of web development. In the near future, Jupyverse may take a different path than JupyterHub for a multi-user scenario.
    - JupyterHub is basically a server of servers. Each individually spawned Jupyter server is quite independent. We might scale Jupyverse differently, so that it remains the only server.
  - [Jupyverse may take a different path than JupyterHub for a multi-user scenario? _202208](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyverse/issues/201)
    - I mean that we will probably not scale Jupyverse by launching a server for each user, but by using other techniques such as replication.
    - I have had some practice in this area, similar to Deepnote, where splitting the kernel, file system, and RTC into individual services.
    - In this respect, jupyverse and FPS would bring a better architecture in a cloud environment (a true WEB IDE architecture), where users would be able to edit code directly without starting any compute resources
