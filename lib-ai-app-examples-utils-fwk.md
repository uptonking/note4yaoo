    - Dify's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module, especially when utilizing the Parent-Child mode with a full document, appears to have a rigid limitation of 10,000 tokens per document. This constraint means that any content exceeding this token count is effectively ignored or truncated before it enters the retrieval process.
    - There is currently no apparent configuration option (for example, in the .env file) that allows users to adjust this maximum token length for RAG processing. 
    - there is no configurable option (neither in .env nor in the UI) to increase the 10,000-token limit in Parent-Child mode.

  - Flexible Low Level Customization: Complete freedom to customize at both high and low levels - from overall workflows and system architecture to granular agent behaviors, internal prompts, and execution logic.
  - Ideal for Every Use Case
  - 🆚 How CrewAI Compares
    - While LangGraph provides a foundation for building agent workflows, its approach requires significant boilerplate code and complex state management patterns. The framework's tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility when implementing custom agent behaviors or integrating with external systems.
    - Autogen: While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process.
    - ChatDev: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited

  - 🎯 [The next evolution of Mastra streaming _202509](https://mastra.ai/blog/mastra-streaming)
    - When we first built Mastra, we relied entirely on Vercel's AI SDK for streaming. It was a pragmatic choice that let us focus on what made Mastra unique: the orchestration layer that sits above language models.
    - But as developers started building more complex apps with Mastra, we kept hitting the same limitations. What happens when an agent calls another agent? How do you stream results from a workflow that contains multiple agents? 
    - Our old implementation worked beautifully for single model calls, but Mastra needed something more.
    - So we built our own streaming layer.
    - The new `format` option we're introducing (like `format: 'aisdk'`) establishes a pattern where Mastra can output streams in whatever format your frontend needs. Today it's AI SDK v5. Tomorrow it could be `copilotkit`, assistant-ui, or a format we haven't even imagined yet.
    - We've written before about nested streaming, but it bears repeating: modern AI applications are compositional. Agents call other agents. Workflows orchestrate multiple models. Tools can be entire applications themselves. Our custom streaming protocol makes these patterns not just possible but elegant.

    - It’s based on UniRoute, Google Research’s new framework for universal model routing across unseen LLMs.
    - Adaptive automatically chooses which LLM to use for every request based on prompt complexity and live model performance.
    - It runs automated evals continuously in the background, clusters prompts by domain, and routes each query to the smallest feasible model that maintains quality.
    - it performs live eval-based routing using UniRoute’s cluster-based generalization method, which can handle unseen LLMs without retraining.
    - Typical savings: 60–90% lower inference cost.
    - Routing overhead: ~10 ms.

  - a powerful organization layer for your local AI API traffic. 
  - A single OpenAI-compatible endpoint that routes AI API requests and spins local models up or down to manage VRAM
  - Run Multiple Automation Tasks: Execute coding agents, chat bots, and summarizers simultaneously without conflict. The orchestrator queues them and switches models instantly.
  - Resource Management: Only one VRAM-heavy model runs at a time. The system automatically unloads idle models and loads the next one required.
  - Route Aliases: Use stable names like route:coding or route:chat. If your primary model is down or overloaded, the system can automatically fall back to another model (local or cloud).
  - Extensibility: Add any OpenAI-compatible provider (Groq, weak-to-strong-generalization rigs, custom RAG APIs) just by dropping a YAML file in the providers/ folder.
  - [Local AI: Managing VRAM by dynamically swapping models via API : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pm36fl/local_ai_managing_vram_by_dynamically_swapping/)
    - Dynamically loads and unloads models on demand (easy to add additional runtimes)
      - Runs one request at a time using a queue to avoid VRAM contention, and groups requests for the same model together to reduce reload overhead
      - The next step is intelligently running more than one model concurrently when VRAM allows.
      - The core idea is treating models as on-demand workloads rather than long-running processes.
    - 🤔 This is now natively supported by llama.cpp.
      - llama.cpp can run image generation, video generation, audio generation and text generation?
    - I'd want to 'set' the limit to be 92GB so I still have VRAM for the system, and for it to close down applications. I've been thinking how to make it more efficient.
      - This is where I'm looking for either V2 or V3 to go. Although my system is much lighter, that assigned to this with concurrency and VRAM monitoring insight.

  - [I built the HuggingChat Omni Router : r/ollama _202510](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1odn14n/i_built_the_huggingchat_omni_router/)
  - HuggingFace relaunched their chat app called Omni with support for 115+ LLMs.
  - The critical unlock in Omni is the use of a policy-based approach to model selection. I built that policy-based router: https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B
  - The core insight behind our policy-based router was that it gives developers the constructs to achieve automatic behavior, grounded in their own evals of which LLMs are best for specific coding tasks like debugging, reviews, architecture, design or code gen
  - Essentially, the idea behind this work was to decouple task identification (e.g., code generation, image editing, q/a) from LLM assignment.
  - The model is also integrated as a first-class primitive in archgw: a models-native proxy server for agents. 
  - https://github.com/katanemo/archgw /4.2kStar/apache2/202510/rust/python
    - https://archgw.com/
    - Arch is a models-native proxy server that handles the plumbing work in AI: agent routing & hand off, guardrails, end-to-end logs and traces, unified access to LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.
    - Arch handles the pesky plumbing work in building AI agents — like applying guardrails, routing prompts to the right agent, generating hyper-rich information traces for RL, and unifying access to any LLM.
    - Arch runs alongside app servers as a containerized process, and builds on top of `Envoy`'s proven HTTP management and scalability features to handle ingress and egress traffic related to prompts and LLMs.
    - Arch was built by the contributors of Envoy Proxy with the belief that: Prompts are nuanced and opaque user requests, which require the same capabilities as traditional HTTP requests including secure handling, intelligent routing, robust observability, and integration with backend (API) systems to improve speed and accuracy for common agentic scenarios – all outside core application logic.

  - It supports the standard, unforked Puppeteer and Playwright libraries, as well offering REST-based APIs for common actions like data collection, PDF generation and more.
  - Parallelism and request-queueing are built-in + configurable.
  - Works with unforked Puppeteer and Playwright.
  - An interactive puppeteer debugger, so you can see what the headless browser is doing and use its DevTools.
  - Support for running and development on Apple's M1 machines
  - 💰 If you want to use Browserless to build commercial sites, applications, or in a continuous-integration system that's closed-source, then you'll need to purchase a commercial license.
  - 💡 Browserless listens for both incoming websocket requests, generally issued by most libraries, as well as pre-build REST APIs to do common functions (PDF generation, images and so on). When a websocket connects to Browserless it starts Chrome and proxies your request into it. 
    - Once the session is done then it closes and awaits for more connections. 
    - Some libraries use Chrome's HTTP endpoints, like /json to inspect debug-able targets, which Browserless also supports.

  - [2025-03-18] We released a technical preview version of a new desktop app - Agent TARS, a multimodal AI agent that leverages browser operations by visually interpreting web pages and seamlessly integrating with command lines and file systems.
    - Comprehensive Tool Support: Integrates with search, file editing, command line, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools to handle complex workflows.
  - https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS /apache2
    - UI-TARS is a next-generation native GUI agent model designed to interact seamlessly with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using human-like perception, reasoning, and action capabilities. 
    - Unlike traditional modular frameworks, UI-TARS integrates all key components—perception, reasoning, grounding, and memory—within a single vision-language model (VLM), enabling end-to-end task automation without predefined workflows or manual rules.
    - This project builds upon and extends the capabilities of Qwen2-VL, a powerful vision-language model, which serves as the foundational architecture for UI-TARS. 
  - https://github.com/web-infra-dev/Midscene /MIT/ts
    - open-source web automation SDK that has supported UI-TARS model. 
    - Midscene.js lets AI be your browser operator. Just describe what you want to do in natural language, and it will help you operate web pages, validate content, and extract data. 
    - Besides the default model GPT-4o, we have added two new recommended open-source models to Midscene.js: UI-TARS and Qwen2.5-VL. (Yes, Open Source !) 
    - Supports Puppeteer and Playwright integration, allowing you to combine AI capabilities with these powerful automation tools
    - Visual Reports for Debugging 🎞️: Through our test reports and Playground, you can easily understand, replay and debug the entire process.

    - but we can keep parser private and web backend open.
    - maybe you can store all the docs in a public database, that way anyone can self-host.

  - It performs URL normalization, HTML parsing, Markdown conversion, and LLM post-processing (using xai_sdk with grok). 
  - Output is serialized in line-delimited JSON (`.jsonl`).
  - A crawler functions similarly to how a graph works. Basically, each web page behaves like a node, where a single node can point to n number of websites, and multiple nodes can point to the same website. The navigation of a crawler is based on the same principle as a graph traversal; in this case, I will base it on a breadth-first search (`BFS`) model.
  - The Crawler module implements a horizontal-scalable architecture, where you can create one Crawler module with hundreds of nodes (sharing the same memmory, but managing hundreds of asynchronous processes).

## streaming-llm

- https://github.com/globalaiplatform/langdiff /225Star/apache2/202509/python/ts
  - https://langdiff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - https://globalaiplatform.github.io/langdiff/
  - LangDiff is a Python library that solves the hard problems of streaming structured LLM outputs to frontends
  - LangDiff provides intelligent partial parsing with granular, type-safe events as JSON structures build token by token, plus automatic JSON Patch generation for efficient frontend synchronization.
  - Streaming Parsing
    - Define schemas for streaming structured outputs using Pydantic-style models.
    - Receive granular, type-safe callbacks (on_append, on_update, on_complete) as tokens stream in.
    - Derive Pydantic models from LangDiff models for seamless interop with existing libraries and SDKs like OpenAI SDK.
  - Change Tracking
    - Track mutations without changing your code patterns by instrumenting existing Pydantic models, or plain Python dict/list/objects.
    - Generate JSON Patch diffs automatically for efficient state synchronization between frontend and backend.
  - The Problem with Traditional Streaming Approaches
    - Even partial JSON parsing libraries that "repair" incomplete JSON don't fully solve the issues
  - The Coupling Problem
    - tightly coupling frontend UIs to LLM output schemas.
  - ✨ LangDiff solves these problems through two key innovations:
    - Intelligent Streaming Parsing: Define schemas that understand the streaming nature of LLM outputs. Get type-safe callbacks for partial updates, complete fields, and new array items as they arrive.
    - Change-Based Synchronization: Instead of streaming raw JSON, track mutations on your application objects and send lightweight JSON Patch diffs to frontends. This decouples UI state from LLM output format.

- [Smooth a stream of LLM tokens into a stream of characters while reducing jitter by stabilising output timing. Explorations of different approaches.](https://gist.github.com/sebinsua/76fc5eb6fc498636bc637b9f10b7e6bf)
  - This approach slows the stream down a little and does generally reduce the jitter (such as pauses and bursts in the token stream). The approach was made based on educated guess-work about what might work and evaluated by eye-balling it instead of in a systematic manner. It is not perfect and sometimes the queue is exhausted only to find that we are waiting on a token. 
  - Another approach might be to extend the function that calculates the delay length by looking at the rate of increase/decrease of the queue size, as this would allow the algorithm to consider 'the future' in its decisions.
  - I experimented trying to put this on the back-end using ai in a Next.js app and a client-side React library on the UI. In order to do so, I had to transform to and from AsyncIterator and ReadableStream
