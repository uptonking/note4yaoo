  - Mastra is an opinionated Typescript framework that helps you build AI applications
  - It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations and evals.
  - You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.
  - Mastra uses the Vercel AI SDK for model routing, providing a unified interface to interact with any LLM provider including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini. 
  - Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions. 
  - Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. 
  - Workflows are durable graph-based state machines. They have loops, branching, wait for human input, embed other workflows
  - RAG lets you construct a knowledge base for agents
  - Evals are automated tests that evaluate LLM outputs using model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods.
