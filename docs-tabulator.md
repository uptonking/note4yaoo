# docs-tabulator

## roadmap

- ref
  - [v4.9 Released - Performance Improvements(and some info on v5.0)](https://github.com/olifolkerd/tabulator/issues/3085)
    - This is going to involve a wholesale refactor of the codebase to take advantage of the tree shaking functionality of ESM to improve package size and to make way for the implementation of unit testing across the library.
    - This is no small update, there will be wide ranging efficiency improvements across the system as well as a range of new features and functionality
    - I am currently aiming to have version 5.0 release in either Feb or March 2021
