- ## ✏️ [Bike: Innovative Rich Text Editing | Hacker News _202211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33489123)
- The "affinity cursor" is a really lovely innovation. Most HTML/DOM/contenteditable based rich text editors end up adding support for virtual cursors that enable you to have the insertion cursor somewhere that the native browser cursor hasn't got support for (next to a floating image, end of a table row). Effectively this is what this is doing.

- Text affinity and the command pallet is innovative. Could probably bundle this up as a Objective-C library that acts as a drop in replacement for UITextView/NSTextView. Perhaps a JS/WebComponent library for `<textarea>` as well. I’m sure you could extract some revenue with licensing those libraries or tech support.

- ## 🤝🏻 Version history as chat: what if you could chat about editing progress with your collaborators right in the history timeline of a document?

  - That's the idea of our latest Patchwork experiment...
  - The goal of this timeline view is to give structure and legibility to the document history.
  - All edits get an AI-generated summary and you can also leave little notes annotating the history in a super informal way

- is chat the right framing here? is it more a timeline? i like this approach.
  - Yeah it’s kinda both depending on how you look at it I think

- ## I'm working on a new feature for http://ogstudio.app, to dynamically generate Open Graph images with custom texts

  - Useful for blog posts, changelogs...

- ## [Building a Text Editor for a Digital-First Newsroom | Hacker News _201804](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16823708)
- ProseMirror requires a certain willingness to work with strict data flow and immutable data structures, and to cobble together a loose set of small modules before you have something user-friendly, but if you can handle that I think it's a safe bet at this point. (Disclaimer: I wrote it, and am heavily biased.)
