- ## ü§ùüèª Version history as chat: what if you could chat about editing progress with your collaborators right in the history timeline of a document?

  - That's the idea of our latest Patchwork experiment...
  - The goal of this timeline view is to give structure and legibility to the document history.
  - All edits get an AI-generated summary and you can also leave little notes annotating the history in a super informal way

- is chat the right framing here? is it more a timeline? i like this approach.
  - Yeah it‚Äôs kinda both depending on how you look at it I think

- ## I'm working on a new feature for http://ogstudio.app, to dynamically generate Open Graph images with custom texts
