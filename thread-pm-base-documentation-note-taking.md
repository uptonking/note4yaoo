- ## 

- ## 总有人来教育我飞书多好用，就好像我没用过飞书一样。
- https://twitter.com/haoel/status/1497197608908976128
  - 工作不是聊天，而是信息交换和共享。首要就是把信息做好，下面这些做不好，别来跟我说好用。
- 1）像邮件一样，让信息归属于一个主题，一个thread，在这个thread下不要打扰到别人。别一发消息就是reply all
- 2）你要把信息沟通工具做成拉群，你就错了。信息就是以频道的方式，不是以拉群的方式。你能明白吗？就像论坛版面一样，我想了解哪个版面， 就去看就好了，而不是拉群。这里的区别有多大，你真的明白吗？频道相当于信息分类 ，拉群不会让你的员工养成把信息归类的好习惯，你团队里的信息全是乱的。
- 3）信息文本支持简单的富文本和Markdown难吗？你知道在很多信息中，加粗、倾斜，下划线，缩进+bullet，对于信息的可读能有多重要吗？  你知道对于我们程序员来说，如果一个工具不能正常高亮显示代码，这工具者有多难用吗？
- 4）这是在中国区的软件中我最废解的一个事，你在聊天中分享一个链接，连个网页的摘要都取不回来，你看看slack, twitter, telegraf分享网页链接是什么样的，这很难学吗？你硬要学微信那个样？不是你是英文的就是国际化了。你连国际化的 Open Graph Protocol 你都不支持，你还好意思说你是国际化？
- 5）你知道一个信息能够被edit有多重要，工作中的信息就应该是准确的，就是可以让人修改的，这样才能够变得更清楚，别说撤回，还可以删除，没有用的信息就是可以删除掉
- 6）你知道为什么聊天可以使用反斜杠来发一些功能性的命令吗？你不是程序员，你不知道这样的方式在体验上有多好，而且也很舒服。/snippet /mute /giphy ... 这些才是国际化的事，而不是要要点过来点过去找不到功能。

- 微信的员工工作都是用企业微信拉群解决问题，新进群的人前面的聊天记录看不了还要手动一个个选再转发，最多还只能选100条，要是问题解决不了还要再拉一个高级点的工程师进群再一个个选择聊天记录转发，连一次性多选都用不了。我还以为他们内部有权限来云聊天记录后进群的人能看到建群以来所有聊天记录
- IM治理公司，尤其是小公司，最后信息没有任何沉淀，全部都是事件驱动的，没有一点计划性。
- 我公司老板就在推崇飞书… 我直接给所有下属说明了涉及正式的工作事项需要进行排期、评审和指派直接负责人的、多部门沟通协作以及特别重要的事项，一律只允许用邮件。群里发些散碎的信息就好，正式的工作沟通不接受群聊或者私聊！
- 飞书有两种群，普通群和话题群。话题群进群后有新话题会收到提示，关注或回复话题后会收到更新推送

- ## What are some apps that use an "infinite canvas" for things other than white-boarding or visual design?
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1479437094552489991
- Node based programming. Shader graphs. Audio effects editors. 2D side scrolling games if they need zoom and are touchpad/mouse/touch based controls
- Many flow/node based programming environments have an infinite canvas. Starting with max/map and puredata up to UE Blueprint, Unity animation state machines, shader graphs, etc etc
- You surely know about it but if you don’t, I think you’d love @KinopioClub (mind mapping, journaling, note-taking on canvas)
- prezi

- ## How are the best Storybooks organized? We surveyed 60 teams to find out.
- https://twitter.com/storybookjs/status/1488919138001207299
  - 📑 Use docs pages for intro, usage guides & design tokens
  - 🍱 Use folders to group components and make navigation easier
  - ✍️ Write stories to show what a component does

- ## We now had five opponents in the competition: @RoamResearch , @obsdmd , @logseq , @craftdocsapp , and @rem_note .
- https://twitter.com/rcvd_io/status/1485256388888641541
- [TfT Performance: Interim(期中的；暂时的) Results](https://www.goedel.io/p/tft-performance-interim-results)
  - Obsidian ranked first in almost every category; 
  - RemNote delivered pretty solid results even with larger data sets
  - Logseq showed that it’s pretty fast on small data sets, but the larger the collection gets, the slower it becomes. 
  - The same goes for Roam Research in contrast to Logseq handles even the big data set, but some of the processing times are annoying.
- [TfT Performance: Methodology](https://www.goedel.io/p/tft-performance-methodology)
  - This is the first article in a series looking at the performance of current applications for Personal Knowledge Management - so-called "Tools for Thought."
  - This is how the generated pages look in Roam Research and in Logseq

- ## Yes, Logseq does copy some features and UX from roam, that's why I open sourced logseq. 
- https://twitter.com/tiensonqin/status/1374351298456219654
  - But Logseq is not a clone, we have two-way sync between plain-text and Datascript, almost full org-mode support, GitHub sync on Web, 
  - and last, we don't store user's data

- ## Announcing http://papertohtml.org, an on-demand PDF to HTML converter for scientific papers!
- https://twitter.com/lucyluwang/status/1437837455902658560
  - HTML is easier to make accessible for screen readers or on mobile. 
- We @curvenote have been working at the opposite-problem how to write html-native papers that export to PDF nicely. (+ keep benefits of metadata/interactivity)

- ## Fragment: A Couple of Unofficial and Unofficial Unofficial Jupyter Extensions for VS Code and the Future of Rich Visual Editing of Interactive Generative Texts
- https://blog.ouseful.info/2021/09/13/on-a-couple-of-unofficial-and-unofficial-unofficial-jupyter-extensions-for-vs-code-and-the-future-of-rich-visual-editing-of-interactive-generative-texts/
- on my long list, one thing I’m hoping to see at some point is an executable document editor running purely in the browser on top of something like a JupyterLite kernel. 
- There are a couple of different directions I think this could come from: 
  - one would be getting something like the Curvenote editor or a Stencila editor working in the browser on top of a JupyterLite WASM powered backend, 
  - and the other would be some plugins to make a Jupyter Book editable, cf. a wiki, with edits saved to browser local storage. 

- ## HelpKit allows you to easily build your company's Knowledge Base or Help Center with @NotionHQ
- https://twitter.com/sobedominik/status/1436016818079076366
  - With HelpKit you can use all the Notion blocks you know and love.
  - No code required
  💨 Ultra fast
  🎨 Customizable
  ✨ Looks professional
  🎛️ Embeddable widget like Intercom or Zendesk
  🔍 Sophisticated search
  🌐 Custom domain

- ## Anyone know of smarter reading time estimation algorithms than words/wordsPerMinute?
- https://twitter.com/wooorm/status/1436262232338444310
  - https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-util-reading-time
- I thought about text to speech + measuring audio length

- ## no idea if this naming is any less confusing but http://natto.dev now has "browser drafts" and "user canvases". 
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1433508225651904522
  - browser drafts are local to your browser not tied to any account. 
  - user canvases are synced to natto's server like your favorite SaaS
  - The differentiation may be premature(未成熟的，过早的) but this is setting up for an offline-capable future.
  - I do think it's nice that you're able to persist state in the app without an account unlike most SaaS

- ## Tried copying in my entire thesis into @curvenote . Learned a new HTML status code: 413. (Too large!)
- https://twitter.com/rowancockett/status/1432935094868594688
  - I know that we *can* handle larger documents via import, but not currently in a single copy-paste event of a few hundred pages which relies on our real-time collaboration.

- ## When reading docs, which mode/code highlight theme combo do you prefer
- https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1430689446664491012
- Code should always be dark, the doc theme should remain consistent with the system preference.
- According to settings in my OS. Light mode light theme at day, dark mode dark theme at night.

- ## The Text2PixelArt neural network (generates pixel art based on text) already allows you to create a good cover images for articles.
- https://twitter.com/sitnikcode/status/1430213610542964740
  - 生成的图片色彩风格都很浓郁，如深红深紫深蓝

- ## Evernote used to have a feature that let you export all of your notes (1943 for me) in one go... 
- https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1430407513606791170
  - but at some point recently they dropped that down to either 50 individually selected notes at a time or everything in a specific notebook
  - github从设计上就解决了此问题，每个仓库单独下载
- More frustrating though... the notes they export used to be valid XML, but now they are not! 
  - Just hit an XML error running my evernote-to-sqlite tool against the ".enex" export file

- ## Just added Markdown, HTML, and CSS as export options. Markdown includes links to hosted assets.
- https://twitter.com/4lpine/status/1428064775372607488
- We use the Theme UI sx prop as part of our internal data structure since we want direct theme mapping and the nesting of CSS-in-JS (Emotion).
  - We're statically extracting the styles to pure CSS using some tricks I hope to write a post on (soon).
  - Also, the declarative and composable nature of a props object that handles styling is so choice for this kind of tooling.

- ## I've been diving into @replicache and I'm convinced its model is what you want for majority of SaaS apps (eg todo apps, figma)
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1415365748675907584
  - client update lifecycle with authoritative server 
  - all these things have tradeoffs and I think it chooses the right ones for most use cases
- It works a lot like git where each client keeps a list of mutations 
  - although instead of the exact "diff" itself, the log contains mutation name and args (you define mutations). pure intention preservation!
  - key here is how client rebases because server is truth
- I've also been diving into https://yjs.dev, an excellent(!) CRDT library. 
  - however, replicache's model is simpler and doesn't impact your backend as much. It's really just an excellent client library with a protocol specification (big points here)
- some tradeoffs
  - you define mutations twice (once on client, once on server)
  - flat KV data structure (hi fractional indexing)
  - authoritative server (no p2p)
  - realtime updates require roundtrip
  - again I think they're reasonable
- natto does some funky iframe sandboxing that makes replicache hard to use right now but I'd use it otherwise!
  - replicache does not handle collaborative text editing rn. yjs/automerge does a good job here. on natto, I'm okay with treating each block's code as atomic unit
- I would say more that @replicache is at a lower level of abstraction than text editing. 
  - We need some good libraries for unstructured text editing on top of Replicache. 
  - You can do it right now with fractional indexing and it will mostly work, but there are likely even better ways
  - Fractional indexing has some known deficiencies when cursors are editing concurrently at exact same position.  
- I suspect that the other CRDT approaches for text editing Martin discusses can equally be applied to Replicache but I haven't had time to dig into it.

- ## Try the omakase layout on http://natto.dev! 
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1388211716001910786
  - Panes rearrange as you move your focus. 
  - Connected panes are shown to the side (inputs on left, outputs on right)
- if there's too much motion, turn on "reduce motion" in your accessibility settings
- I am pretty excited about dynamically showing related content in tools. eg showing incoming/outgoing calls when you're focused on a function in your editor
  - seems like a natural feature
