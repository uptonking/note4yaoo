- ## 

- ## We need to find tools which can exchange contexts between the tools like Claude Code, CoWork, Codex App, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, VSC. 
- https://x.com/sabrishsurender/status/2018525743425474606
  - Context here means all the logs and inferences and not just the end code

- ## 想法实现了，在 Cloudflare Containers 运行 OpenCode ，再通过 S3FS 实现数据持久化 和 Cloudflared 进行远程访问预览页面。
- https://x.com/miantiao/status/2015283393752416714
  - 随时随地，任意终端都可以 Vide 编程了。
  - 容器会在你不使用的10分钟后缩放至 0，不收钱。
  - 代码就 200 行，直接开源了 https://github.com/miantiao-me/cloud-code
  - Cloudflare Containers 的持久存储就要来了，有个想法把 Containers 搞成一个云端电脑，按需启动计费。 外面面套一个 Zero Trust 做访问控制。

- 如果是想随时远程访问的话，其实可以试试cf的隧道，可以直接把一个内网的端口给转发到具体域名上，从而实现外网访问。 而且目前直接使用opencode的gui的话，我目前使用上review中记录的diff会出现遗漏，所以现在已经转向vibe kanban了

- 能恢复下次接着 vibe 吗
  - 可以的， opencode 数据持久化了

- Cold start time 怎样？上次（一个月前）用 Cloudare Sandbox 试过一样的 idea 记得有点慢，最后换 E2B 了。另外 S3FS 很慢，要git commit 都很慢，要 install node_modules 就基本不可能了，除非每次启动都重新 install 到 local，但是那样冷启动就更慢了。还是 sandbox 自带 volume 的比较靠谱
  - 冷启动并不快，加上 opencode 启动也慢，每次冷启动得 10s 多 但是非生产服务，冷启动慢也无所谓了。
  - S3 慢的问题我尽可能把 S3 和容器都放在美西来减少延迟，但是容器目前没法强制区域。
  - sandbox 自带 volume 靠谱？ sandbox 是只 Cloudflare sandbox 吗？  这个底层也是容器+S3, 原理应该是一样的

- ## [Notes after using Claude Code and OpenCode side by side : r/opencodeCLI _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1qu44yh/notes_after_using_claude_code_and_opencode_side/)
  - Claude Code feels guarded and structured. It plans carefully, asks before doing risky stuff, and generally prioritizes safety and predictability.
  - OpenCode feels more like raw infrastructure. You pick the model per task. It runs commands, edits files, and you validate by actually running the code. More control, less hand-holding.
  - Both got the job done when I tried real tasks (multi-file refactors, debugging from logs). Neither “failed.” The difference was how they worked, not whether they could.

- The only feature from CC that I miss is that CC can run bash commands in the background and easily check its logs. That's it. For everything else, OpenCode is superior. Once you set your custom modes, and add plugins, it's awesome.
  - There is an opencode pty plugin for that

- The only i miss when moving from CC is /rewind . Opencode has something less powerful /undo but it’s tedious to use and buggy.

- The main thing OpenCode can really fail on is picking back up on things if you need to run out of usage and/or need to switch models/providers. OpenCode’s flow is already so rigid (with task management being handled in the conversation), and Superpowers expects the full lifecycle of its skills to complete a task, and doesn’t wrap up things if you get interrupted.

- ## [Mistral Vibe 2.0 : r/LocalLLaMA _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qt76qs/mistral_vibe_20/)
- tell us why use it instead of OpenCode. They both seem to copy ClaudeCode as far as I can see.
  - IMHO if you use Devstral, use Vibe. Each agentic tool has a different massive system prompt with slightly different tool definitions. It seems that every AI lab is fine-tuning their model to perform better with their harness. They’ll all work on every CLI, sure, but Kimi 2.5 will surely perform better with Kimi CLI, Sonnet with Claude Code, GPT with Codex, etc.
  - Z.ai seems to be the holdout so far, they haven’t released a CLI, so they chose to tune their models for Claude Code. 

- opencode doesn't support markdown tables

- I haven't use mistral-vibe much yet, but I like how short the code is compared to alternatives

- ## [droid是啥, 为啥好多人推荐, 跟Claude code或者opencode之类的区别在哪 ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1482186)
- 闭源版本的 opencode，可以用多个模型
  - 比 claudecode 好的地方在于模型可以多选，包括 glm，claude，gpt，且终端能力差不多
  - 比 codex 好的地方在于 windows 下表现良好

- 其实大家的cli工具都更新很快，可能现在好用，但是更新几个版本就不一定了。但是最懂claude都肯定是claudecode，最懂gpt的肯定是codex，没必要折腾这些其实。

- ## [编程cli交流，droid和opencode 对比，还有模型能力对比 _202601](https://linux.do/t/topic/1414233)
  - 用 opencode 和 droid ，用我的dsl (这个特别考验智力，因为没有训练到)，用相同模型，干同一个任务，看看时间最短。
  - 不过opencode 有子agent 可以减少主agent的上下文，羡慕啊，不知道droid怎么搞，有没有大佬会搞。
  - 样本太少了，我大概只测了五六次左右，不过在我这个自定义dsl 场景，考验模型迁移能力情况下，只能说minimax 2.1 是比较强的。

- 如果minimax不要求2.1的话可以试试用Google部署的minimax2，用TPU速度能达到160tok/s，我们已经拿来跑一些流程长的subagent了

- 昨天用opencode，token真的节约

- 有一点我觉得opencode做的还行, 就是新版本的deepseek在opencode上对思考做的适配更积极

- Droid也有subagent，不过它叫droids

- ## [Forked Google's Gemini CLI to work with local LLMs (MLX, llama.cpp, vLLM) : r/LocalLLaMA _202512](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1pn0gpa/forked_googles_gemini_cli_to_work_with_local_llms/)
  - So i forked the gemini cli and added local llm support, no google account needed, runs offline.

- ## [Looking for an alternative to ClaudeCode. Is OpenCode + GLM 4.7 my best bet? : r/opencodeCLI _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1q8bcsg/looking_for_an_alternative_to_claudecode_is/)
- I tried OpenCode + GLM 4.7 and honestly GLM 4.7 has been pretty error-prone for Android work (Gradle/Kotlin DSL quirks, shaky API assumptions, and fixes that don’t compile on the first try).

- glm 4.7 + cc >>>>>> glm 4.7 + opencode

- [Looking for an alternative to ClaudeCode. Is OpenCode + GLM 4.7 my best bet? : r/opencodeCLI](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1q8bcsg/looking_for_an_alternative_to_claudecode_is/)
  - i tried glm 4.7 with opencode coming from claude code with opus but tbh it felt like bit retarded junior dev compared to cc with opus or sonnet, especially with rust. i wouldnt say its bad, prolly just my expectations that it might come close to what i got used to with cc/opus were maybe just too high, also the language support (slovak) with glm is just bad

- ## [Opencode vs Codex CLI: Same Prompt, Clearer Output — Why? : r/opencodeCLI _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1qdujsl/opencode_vs_codex_cli_same_prompt_clearer_output/)
- Coding agent clients (sometimes referred to as harnesses) have their own prompt engineering flows. those include the system prompt, compacting strategies, context lookups, code indexing and more. Behind the scenes you plugged them to the same model with the same user prompt, but the model received a whole lot of different prompt that just happens to include a part of it that is identical
  - opencode system prompts are open

- ## [OpenCode with GPT is next level : r/codex _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1qee31p/opencode_with_gpt_is_next_level/)
- How is OpenCode better than Codex CLI?
  - Interface. Speed. Sub agents. LSP.
- From my experience Codex CLI still offers the best experience. I’d really like to replace it with Opencode but it’s missing the precision I value so much with the Codex harness. Unfortunately.
  - Codex CLI is better at understanding my intent and is conservative with solutions. While Opencode thinks more, writes more code and brings more work to the table I did not intent. Therefore I have to do more iterations which often just makes it worse.
  - I understand this is probably caused by the fact that OpenAI has locked the system prompt to Codex for ChatGPT subscribers. Which Opencode then has to amend with instructions specific to Opencode. The experience with an API key might be totally different.

- what's the biggest different and benefits of using that over Codex CLI? Is that mainly I can switch models or something else?
  - Ease of use, speed, sub-agents, LSP.

- ## [I tested Claude 4.5, GPT-5.1 Codex, and Gemini 3 Pro on real code (not benchmarks) : r/ChatGPTCoding _202511](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1p9vpyz/i_tested_claude_45_gpt51_codex_and_gemini_3_pro/)
- I tried both Sonnet 4.5 and Gemini 3 Pro High to build a site from scratch. Sonnet’s UI is way cleaner, almost no layout issues. Gemini, on the other hand, had some pretty obvious problems, like everything getting stuck to the left instead of being centered

- ## [I tried Gemini 3 for a couple of days ... Codex is still the best. By far.. : r/codex _202512](https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1pf7pc1/i_tried_gemini_3_for_a_couple_of_days_codex_is/)
- i use codex for backend and cleaning up code from the others, opus to do both frontend/backend if i run out of antigravity/codex, and gemini for front end. they have their niches but overall opus is the most flexible ime

- Gemini sucks at anything agentic. It ignores instructions, it’s lazy and it can’t handle large contexts. It’s a benchmaxxed mess.

- I am paying both of the memberships but I will keep the OpenAI one. Gemini takes too much decisions by itself when I give clear instructions.

- I just used gemini 4+ hours yesterday and when the context gets too big it start hallucinating like hell. That never happened with codex.

- I find the same.. Gemini 3 made so many mistakes it’s just not worth the hassle… also if you leave it alone it looped on me several times. Codex and Claude simply never give me issues like that.

- ## [Gemini CLI is impressive, but Claude Code is acting like the real senior engineer : r/ClaudeCode _202512](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1pdyq6z/gemini_cli_is_impressive_but_claude_code_is/)
- I tried most agents and I still find Claude Code to be the most capable and reliable one. There are certain cases where I would use another agent to aid solving problems that Claude Code might get stuck in but usually it is the main agent I use. 
  - Collaborative agents are going to be the future where a team of agents can work on a task or a task would be assigned to the most reliable and efficient agent capable of solving it.

- Opus is superior. However, tou will drastically increase your output quality if you use both (one as the driver, one as the reviewer). Sometimes if its a really complex task I'll even use two reviewers. I actually built an open-source tool to automate this

- I have tested Gemini 3 Pro Preview and Claude Opus 4.5 multiple times having each generate security audit report on multiple popular GitHub projects (Cherry Studio, Chatbox, Jan, etc). Claude has consistently found more issues than Gemini even though it has less than a quarter of the context window as Gemini. When I ask Gemini whether Claude’s additional issues found were accurate, Gemini has consistently responded that they were accurate.

- Gemini is great at looking at everything and Codex is pretty good for finding weird logic flow bugs. But Opus 4.5, gets it right most of the time. If you tell it to follow a plan, enforce code-quality checks, and test-driven development, basically the same stuff I force myself to do but don't want to. It creates shippable code with few iterations; sometimes straight out of the gate.

- ## [Gemini 3.0 Pro has been out for long enough. For those who have tried all three, how does it (in Gemini CLI) shape up compared to Codex CLI and Claude Code (both CLI and models)? : r/ChatGPTCoding _202512](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1pi4ojr/gemini_30_pro_has_been_out_for_long_enough_for/)
- gemini sometimes one shots things that take "workhorse" codex forever to figure out, but it is a fickle beast. it has moments of brilliance and occasional periods of insanity

- Codex is stupidly slow. It sometimes gets stuck on harder things and basically implements nothing. But pretty good and reliable for basic stuff and never seems to hit limits. It sometimes surprises me with clever solutions.
  - Claude is good for making project wide changes while still being in control. But the sessions limits are absolutely ridiculous
  - Gemini seems pretty good in analyzing the project. But when it uses 2.5 instead of 3 it can get quite stupid more often than Claude or Codex do.
  - At least for my uses cases they are all somewhat similar. Transparency, speed, limits and ease of use matter more to me. Sometimes Claude gets stuck on a problem, sometimes it's Codex, sometimes it's Gemini, and then the other agents somehow manage to solve it. Managing the context matters in that as well, I guess, and in some it's just better or easier.

- I have the max plan for all 3. 
  - Gemini produces the best UI but is the worst at following instructions. 
  - Codex is the best at code review, debugging, and architectural decisions / implementing new architecture, but requires handholding and requires you to prompt it to continue working. 
  - Opus 4.5 is the best actual daily driver, amazing at following instructions, best general "assistant" outside of coding (e.g. LLM cofounder esque activities), and goes without saying also great at coding

- the Gemini CLI with Gemini 3 is excellent for user interfaces. Neither Claude Code nor Codex CLI focuses on that, but Gemini builds much better interfaces.

- Gemini simply doesn’t follow instructions properly like codex

- ## [Best AI Coding Tool: Gemini CLI, Codex, or Claude Code : r/vibecoding _202510](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1oa9d5o/best_ai_coding_tool_gemini_cli_codex_or_claude/)
- Sadly, there is no best. They all seem to excel at different things. 
  - In my experience, Codex is a strong backend developer. 
  - Claude seems better at UI/UX. 
  - I use Gemini for planning and research given its huge context window and obvious search ties. But its implementation is terrible.
  - You also want to get in the habit of having the AI double and triple check each others work. If you only use one company’s LLM, use different sessions with separate context and different agents to analyze the work and catch bugs.
  - The reality is that every new generation of model is likely to surpass the last, so don’t get locked into one company. They are all staggered now it seems so every 2-3 months there is a new SOTA frontier model - use that one.

- ## [Codex、GeminiCLI真的弱于Claude Code吗 _202601](https://linux.do/t/topic/1420013)
  - 两个都体验过后，发现都还是不如CC, 这是事实吗？还是我自己的使用方式不对
- GEMINI CLI不知道，CODEX CLI强的一批
- CODEX CLI 非前端任务无敌。前端就是默认的审美一般，提示词到位也不错。

- codex非常强，使用体验甚至比cc好

- 看场景吧，前端页面GeminiCLI很强，修bug、做服务端的话Codex很强
- 弄Java的话，Codex根本不输CC啊，只是有点慢而已，我反而更喜欢Codex
  - +1，我现在每天是把codex蹬完再用cc，中间要改页面就切到gemini
- gemini做做前端还可以 codex不逊色cc

- 我的体验 codex 5.2 xh > claude opus 4.5, opus 4.5经常偷懒

- 我现在用 cx 写代码, cc 用来解释代码, cc 解释代码比较详细一点, 也快一些

- 在嵌入式领域， claudecode 不如 codex 一根

- codex挺强的，就是gpt太慢了
- 复杂任务codex强过cc就是实在是太慢了

- codex真的强，特别是配置GPT-5.2-HIGTH

- gemini-cli 虽然介面用起来，至少调色不错，体验也还行。 但是缺东缺西的，适配 skills 也是最慢的才弄好的，而且常常调用它 2.5-flash-lite 的去选择模型发任务的时候，竟然是 2.5-flash-lite 开始无限轮回，卡在那边不会动

- gemin cli是真不行，每次codex忙的时候让他干点复杂的就容易寄
  - codex是真可以，如果不是额度不够真的啥都直接交给他就行
  - 改改页面什么的确实gemini的审美还算能看

- gemini cli最好的用法就是2api出来做对话

- ## [使用同样的大模型，Claude code 、Google Gemini CLI、Qwen CLI 区别大吗 _202601](https://linux.do/t/topic/1443293)
- 模型一样的话，处理问题区别不大吧，就看使用习惯和你用途了，CC 权限多，文件读写、终端执行、工程搜索这些都行，其他的普通CLI只能给你建议代码，而且CC还有MCP

- 使用体验完全不一样，Claude Code> Gemini > Qwen
  - 即便是相同模型，Skills，Sub-Agents，丰富的工作流生态，都不是GEMINI和QWEN可以比的

- claude code原生不带回退真的挺痛苦的，如果只考虑宿主的话我还是更喜欢cursor。

- 写代码这件事情上，还是有IDE窗口更加直观。习惯了cursor，cli不如cursor。
  - 另外近期在研究调用AI生成一些报告，这一块调用claude -p挺好用，这一点也算是cli工具的优势了吧。
  - 为什么采用这种方式，因为工作环境会有很多代码、数据，需要AI进行分析，OpenApi的方式不够友好了

- ## [分享一个拿opencode干非coding活的思路(DIY cowork) ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1534786)
  - 自己平时除了coding还有一些杂活，尤其涉及到一些文件材料台账的收集、准备、处理。因此这段时间折腾了下，拿opencode自己跑出了一套对自己而言还算可以的流程，在这里给大家分享下。
  - 准备了一个文件夹：vibe_working，里面的结构是：
  - 0.runtime: RULES
  - 1.todo
  - 2.processing
  - 3.archived
  - todo里面就是待干的事情，以文件夹为一个项目。processing就是处理中的，处理完后放archived里。
  - 不知道有没有佬友会有skills焦虑，总觉得要准备一堆skills来开干。我自己的经验是，只要先弄个authropic官方的skill-creator这个skill，后续的都不急，甚至大部分都不用
  - 你需要哪些skill，完全可以在流程跑通后，和opencode说下把刚才的整个流程变成一个skill，它就会调用skilll-creator去创建对应的skill了。我将其命名为生长型skill，即很自然的用它，用完好用的能跑通的，就把整个跑通的流程变成对应的skill，整个skill无需你自己动手去写。
  - 我自己尝试了几个项目了，包括word、excel、pdf等文件的处理都很可以，而且还有一个这类因为没有特别难的coding问题，完全可以用国内的几个模型，更加便宜。
  - 等你自己工作上的几种常见的活都跑过一遍后，汇总成了成熟的skill，后续完全可以让其自动化操作了。

- ## [OpenCode Ecosystem feels overwhelmingly bloated : r/opencodeCLI _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1qmwcp1/opencode_ecosystem_feels_overwhelmingly_bloated/)
  - I often check OpenCode ecosystem and update my setup every now and then to utilize opencode to the max. I go through every plugins, projects ...etc. However, i noticed most of these plugins are kinda redundant. Some of them are kinda promoting certain services or products, some of them feel outdated, some of them are for very niche use cases.
  - It kinda takes time to go through every single one and understand how to utilize it. I wonder what are you plugin and project choices from this ecosystem ?

- You don't need to use any of that shit. Opencode is just fine on its own
  - Opencode with few selected skills is most certainly 80/20 rule.

- I've been running OpenCode with absolutely nothing but custom sub agents, custom commands, and a few MCP servers.
  - Just because the ecosystem is bloated doesn't mean you have to use bloated software.

- Reminds me of MCP; you go crazy adding a ton… 6 months later you stop using MCP
  - The only plugin I use is to send notifications when the agent is waiting on me.
  - I probably will try to find a plugin (or write one) that helps protect against unexpected deletes… had a CC hook for that… just not ported
- I think all abstractions like skills, mcp, sub agents etc are anti-patterns. They will all disappear when the models get better

- ## [Does Oh-My-Opencode really provide an advantage? : r/opencodeCLI _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1q425mn/does_ohmyopencode_really_provide_an_advantage/)
- I tested it with a few feature implementations, in parallel with vanilla Opencode and Claude Code, and I didn't like how it performed. It used a ton more tokens and I didnt find the work any better. YMMV. I do have very detailed plans so maybe it negates some of what its supposed to bring

- I have similar observations — everything from ohmyopencode runs fast at first, but after 2–3 tasks the tokens are gone for 4 hours. I had the same issue with my own sub-agents (architect–builder–reviewer). The orchestrator rarely used the subtasks with cheaper models.
  - I’m starting to think that a simple plan/build setup with MCP for documentation and web search might actually solve things better and cheaper.

- Dude you are not wrong. I also tried it and I was being carless found out quickly that both my Opus, GLM and codex had downgraded ALOT from their respective original CLIS. The systemprompting in OH my Opencode is shit it is based on a bible of instructions and other weird rules LLMs in general should followi. And all this without any backup about evidence in LLM productivity. The models will become less intelligent unless you dont rewrite it all but theb you could just make your own setup.

- I think no. Most of the heavy lifting lies in the model capability itself nowadays. With just 200K context, doing extra fancy things just hurt the performance and gain you nothing but being rate limited imo. The Keep It Simple Stupid principle always stand.

- ## [OpenCode + OpenWebUi? : r/opencodeCLI _202511](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1oljb0k/opencode_openwebui/)
  - Is There a way to integrate opencode with a web interface instead of using it via TUI?

- Opencode has sdk to interact with opencode server. TUI actualy client of the server. So I think its possible to build web client for it

- You can use official desktop package
  - it’s also a web client

- ## [Codex in OpenCode : r/codex _202512](https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1pz5p2r/codex_in_opencode/)
- When comparing opencode with another tool, it's better to compare it with CC than codex, as a TUI. Because opencode is so ahead of codex in feature parity and trades blows with CC in QOL features. I use it as my daily driver and it has nearly all the features I want and if not, there are plugins. The automatic LSP and formatter integrations will save you a lot of compilation errors because the agent automatically gets the errors fed back to it when it makes syntax errors or similar, which is very valuable. Automatic formatting will make your code cleaner, the codex team have instructions in their AGENTS.md for how to run just fmt after every step to ensure formatting etc, this comes automatically in opencode, something that even CC doesn't have. They're now adding native LSP tools like symbol searching, renaming etc so soon the agent will not be globing and rg-ing its way around

- Would you say that after switching to using Codex in/with OpenCode you can’t see yourself using pure Codex Cli alone because it’s just better (an upgrade) to use OpenCode on top? 
  - I return to codex sometimes to just see what's up but their development is very slow in comparison with competitors and honestly opencode is the main cli tool that is very active, not vibe coding targeting, that's actually using good engineering in its making that's provider agnostic. Subagents are implemented via a native tool called task, it spawns a subagent that you can zoom in to see its context which is a better UX than CC. There's a built-in subagent for exploration, read-only. But you can create subagents as you want, also main agents are a thing, they're translated to modes that you can tab between. Slash commands can spawn subagents with extra context which is powerful if you want an agent that's focused and not polluted by your chat's context, that's the system for their review slash command. They added skills support lately which is awesome as well
- i just run multiple codex instances and then have them read and write to a md file or a database if they need ot memorize stuff....like all these things are super simple and dont require more complexity is my opinion.

- there are also people who love the simplicity of Codex

- I use both Codex CLI and OpenCode; OpenCode has some cool features (switching agents with different models and different briefings), sub-agents etc. I rarely use more than a planning agent and an edit agent in OpenCode; most of the time I just use Codex CLI TBH. I'm using OpenCode with the OAuth plugin to use my subscription which works very well.

- ## [coming as a CC user, what does OpenCode has that's got everyone raving about? : r/opencodeCLI _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/opencodeCLI/comments/1qa4h9e/coming_as_a_cc_user_what_does_opencode_has_thats/)
- While one of the biggest differences is that OpenCode not bind with models from one company. You can choose any models you want. Every agent can have its own model so you can choose the best model in different tasks

- No flickering.
  - Copy and paste works reliably.
  - LSP
  - Clear view of the task list.
  - Sub-agents from different providers for better self-checking.
  - It's faster.
  - Better content management.
- Copy and paste doesn't work for me at all in WSL lol. In CC it works fine though

- haven't used cc for a while, but really like the /undo OpenCode command that reverts last AI changes.
  - CC has /revert or double Esc for this
- I still wonder how many vibecoders don't know that git basically exists.
  - Using the same git for human and AI sucks. I want the main git to only record "verified" changes and a separate temporary history for all the random AI generated intermediate steps. I don't even want the agent to be able to modify the main git without permission. I think Roo code uses a "shadow git", which might be the better option.

- Lsp integration is nice

- flexibility with your workflow, you can set any model and customize it to any extent like max token window, thinking, etc there is so many settings good for nerds or newbs
  - fast support from the team, discord always active
  - most important of all, context management is superior compared to cc, output are better. i one shotted my real work tasks as RND in my company 95% of the times.

- Agents, scripts as tools for agents

- ## [Why is opencode so popular? : r/vibecoding _202601](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1qf0u10/why_is_opencode_so_popular/)
  - It looks cool, it can use literally any model, it's got plugins for providers, it's super customizable
  - But I'm struggling to get into it because:
  - There's no sandbox option
  - There are two primary agents by default in OpenCode. Build mode is basically yolo. It edits and runs commands freely with zero permission.

- ## [OpenCode 启动速度慢？可能是这个原因（从 29s 优化到 3s）以及插件分享 ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1443795)
  - 我的 OpenCode 启动速度非常慢，体验远不如 Claude Code 
  - 通过 `opencode --print-logs` 打印日志，发现时间基本都耗在插件安装上
  - oh-my-opencode@latest 安装	12.89s	每次启动都重新下载

- ## 如果你喜欢 Claude Code，那么你一定要用 OpenCode。
- https://x.com/huangyihe/status/2007472975952408724
  - 模型自由：Claude、GPT、Gemini甚至本地模型，随便切换，谁强用谁。
  - 完美兼容：Claude Skills拿来即用，复制粘贴进.opencode/skills即可。
  - 原生多Agent：内置 Plan/Build 双模式，配合Oh My OpenCode，直接变身AI开发团队。

- 这种“混合模型架构”在处理长上下文时存在一个致命隐患：不同厂商模型的 Tokenizer 差异。如果在 Plan 阶段用了 Claude（基于 BPE 变体），而在 Build 阶段切到了本地的 Llama 3（基于 TikToken 变体），在传递 Context 时是否会发生 Token Count 的剧烈抖动甚至截断？特别是当上下文超过 32k 时，本地小模型的“注意力迷失”（Lost in the Middle）现象会导致生成的代码完全忽略 Plan 阶段定义的接口规范。
  - 可以增加一个AI都读的明白的管道plan阶段让GPT写，写成md放到.claude下面，然后换成Claude让它按照md格式的plan去完成即可。而且本身这种VBC方式也更加规范
  - 这需要严格的上下文工程来控制，每完成一个任务更新文档

- 得看啥任务，多agent到现在依然有上下文损失的风险，不如cx一口气做完

  - 我个人很喜欢在终端上工作，所以也尝试了各种CLI。其中明显感觉gemini的这个CLI明明交互很好，整体UI看着也很舒服，但实际上一输出内容，经常就是不看上下文瞎编。。antigravity里就还好些
- 模型不同，Antigravity里面用的是opus

- 同感。有时候我感觉google他们家的ai coding领域的工具和理念自成一派，甚至会怀疑是不是自己不会用，怎么会这么难用。

- I guess it's a network proxy problem. Last week I solve it by change my proxy point. But this week I can't fix it again
  - export ALL_PROXY="http://127.0.0.1:7890" is ok
  - that works for cli, but not for vscode codex entension with ssh connection in linux server.
- 问题一般是 VSCode 从 GUI 启动时没有继承代理/环境变量。从能用 codex 的终端输入code . 启动vscode(先在终端中先运行一下codex，然后退出codex，最后再启动vscode)，如果新打开的vscode里能用codex插件，则就是这个问题！想要根治这个问题有两大方法：①在vscode里配置系统代理；②把代理/Key写入到“系统级环境”，使得GUI启动vscode也可以走代理。

- ## [codex写算法后端不是ccode能比的 _202602](https://linux.do/t/topic/1552314)
  - 亲身体验，好几次让他俩一起干同一个项目，只要涉及到比较复杂的逻辑或者算法。 codex 一般都能把结果弄出来。
  - 但是 claudecode 陷入 bug 后一直拗不过来，改来改去还是有 bug。
  - claude 时候简单的增删查改业务，但是涉及到复杂逻辑还是交给 codex 来做吧。专业事交给专业的人来做

- 是的，但是 codex 有时候太 nerd，得 claude 监工 / 润色 prd / 提醒写注释

- ## [看到有人说codex好用，但为什么我感觉它工作效率好低 ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1515526)
  - 看到有写佬说codex好用，但是我在实际使用过程中总感觉codex过于啰嗦，一个同样的问题claude code 很快就能解决了，codex能啰嗦半天。所以这个好用是怎么样才好用。

- 我觉得因为他便宜，差距没有拉开多少，干嘛不用

- 很多问题 用gpt5.1-mini 或者 把思考时间调小一点。
- 要用gpt5.2

- codex我都是用来解决Claude Code解决不了的问题的。一般Claude Code 3次改不好的我都直接让codex来改了，效果还不错。或者对整个文件进行质量审查啥的。
- 问题少啊。。。cc快是快。。。一个问题反复改，总不好啊。。cx慢过慢，但是一般一次过。
- 但是codex的正确率高啊，它虽然没有claude code快，但是我都使用后感觉codex的正确率要高

- 1. DEBUG，比如说有什么你操作时候发现的BUG，你用自己的表述告诉codex，它倒腾思考半天后能准确识别到问题所在。cc虽然快，但是根本问题有时候就没解决，只解决了表象，再次测试BUG还在。所以很多workflow里cc写完都会让codex去做代码review。
  - 2. 项目的后端规划。gpt5.2-high和xhigh的规划完整性比cc好。
  - 3. 官方账号使用codex它的auto compact丢失的信息少。因此会有做好规划和步骤后让codex连跑一百多个issue十几二十个小时都没大毛病出现的场景。

- ## 🆚 [Codex or cline : r/CLine _202511](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLine/comments/1p3j75w/codex_or_cline/)
- I need to spend more time with Codex, I’ll say that first but it is Cline for me atm because:
  - Can use multiple LLMs easily with openrouter
  - Plan/Act mode is fantastic - I don’t like agents that can just go off and start editing code without my say so
  - Task based approach on Cline also shows the cost in dollars of each task this is great to measure cost/benefit
  - I build three tier apps so always test changes locally (lowcost) for app and app layer (personally I always use DB in cloud eg Atlas MongoDB)
  - As per 4 not sure how to test deployment in cloud with Codex presumably have to spin up more envs?
  - As per 5 no value for me doing dev from chat on my phone in the middle of the night. If I can’t test the result on desktop what’s the point?

- Both cline and codex now have VS Code extensions and CLIs. CLI is a crucial component, allowing them to run automatically on the server.
  - However, I still feel that the CLI is not convenient enough. I have been using Warp recently, which puts AI capabilities directly in the terminal, so there is no need to enter additional commands to start a CLI, which is very convenient.
  - Of course, I now see most tools trying to cover all aspects, including mobile apps, the web, and terminals. If you choose now, I think you can use each one for a month to compare your experience, cost, and other factors, since everyone's usage scenarios are different.

- ## [why nobody ads codex in vibe code platforms ? : r/codex _202511](https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1os38ox/why_nobody_ads_codex_in_vibe_code_platforms/)
- Because Codex is more of an engineers tool. It’s slow, but with proper instruction, does well.
  - Vibe coders don’t know what to tell the AI, they depend on the AI figuring it out for them. And because codex is so slow, it just wouldn’t be very useful for the vast majority of them.

- ## 🐛 [Does Codex do sub agents? : r/codex _202510](https://www.reddit.com/r/codex/comments/1ohto4f/does_codex_do_sub_agents/)
- Codex only works problems sequentially.
  - Claude has sub agents where you can spin up other agents with specific instructions and have them operate in parallel, directed by Claude or another subagents (or no other agent).

- no but Codex doesn't do dom agents either
  - what we need is an agent that can switch between the two roles

- ## [Codex CLI vs Claude Code vs Claude Code + Z.ai API — which one’s worth it? : r/ClaudeCode _202509](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeCode/comments/1nepo9y/codex_cli_vs_claude_code_vs_claude_code_zai_api/)
- I use CC to analyze and generate tasks, which I then use with GLM to complete. It works quite well and does a more than acceptable job.

- Codex CLI is genuine crap. Anything is better than codex CLI as tool.
  - Codex cli uses freaking toml, huge red flag.
  - There is not local mcp config, no way to share it or version it for project.
  - And tool configuration... I didn't comprehend it.
  - their SDKs are nightmare to work with, literally made by smartasses who never worked with direct clients.
- literally every cli tool tries to be compatible, where codex just being special.
