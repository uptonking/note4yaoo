- ## 💫 [Fine-grained Markdown | Code Hike _202407](https://v1.codehike.org/blog/fine-grained-markdown)
- You want a richer medium to present your content. Let me show you what I mean, and how Code Hike can help you solve this problem.

- https://x.com/pomber/status/1813553314652627118
- Great work! I remember codehike not working with Astro, has this changed since?
  - still not working

- ## I am looking for a broken link checker tool that I can run against localhost.
- https://twitter.com/alexandereardon/status/1758252484165025931
  - For clarity: the markdown is being used to generate a website, and that website is currently running on my localhost
  - I started writing my own using puppeteer - but I keep thinking that surely one already exists

- since a lot renderers use remark / mdast under the hood i was going to suggest remark-validate-links

- ## I appreciate the nod to "File over app" from @mbostock and the @observablehq team in the latest announcement.
- https://twitter.com/kepano/status/1758202572446581025
  - It's so cool that a Markdown file with code blocks can be the source for complex data visualizations and dashboards. This means the files are interoperable with @obsdmd .
- Your post strengthened my conviction in this evolution of Observable. Interoperability for the win!! Thanks for trying Framework, too.
- Probably worth mentioning @evidence_dev , a BI library integrating markdown and SQL for elegant data analytics and visualization

- ## [Thoughts On Markdown _202202](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/thoughts-on-markdown/)
- At Sanity.io, we decided early that the block content format should never assume HTML as neither input nor output, and that we could use algorithms to synchronize text strings. 
  - More importantly, was it that block content and rich text should be deeply typed and queryable. 
  - The result was the open specification Portable Text. 
  - Its structure not only makes it flexible enough to accommodate custom data structures as blocks and inline spans; it’s also fully queryable with open-source query languages like GROQ.
- Portable Text isn’t design to be written or be easily readable in its raw form; it’s designed to be produced by an user interface, manipulated by code, and to be serialized and rendered where ever it needs to go.

- Embracing The Legacy Of Markdown
  - Markdown is not great for the developer experience in modern stacks
  - Markdown is not great for editorial experience
  - Markdown is not great in block content age, and shouldn’t be forced into it. Block content needs to: Be untangled from HTMLisms and presentation agnostic.

- https://x.com/kmelve/status/2001357524130574462
  - markdown as a cms is a bad idea
- Now do typst!  It seems to have so much potential (especially for print/pdf publishing)
- You're clearly someone who is being paid off by SubStack, WordPress, and Sanity. 

- ## You shouldn't use Markdown for content anymore.
- https://twitter.com/kmelve/status/1494688125980798978
  - The demands of digital content have outpaced MD, so it's time to move on and figure out how we can do better.
  - Developers have shoehorned MD into a lot of places, even though it comes with significant trade-offs being non-standardized (even the attempts at standards aren't reliable) and quirky to parse. Plain text files don't equal being portable.
  - Markdown should be opt-in, and sure, MD-like shortcuts can be neat if you're used to it. But I wish we used our creative energy & engineering savviness to build great authoring experiences and presentation-agnostic formats, instead of forcing MD on people who never asked for it.
  - I'm coming at this as a pro Markdown user. I was _bought in_
  - But I have also felt the huge pain and friction in trying to port and salvage websites with all their content locked-in in markdown files and custom tags. 
  - It's costly and nearly and not a great use of time to get that content into a sensible and workable format.

- ## Shortcodes vs MDX
- https://www.swyx.io/shortcodes-vs-mdx-3d4e/
- There are two prevalent solutions for injecting dynamic content into markdown: Shortcodes and MDX. 
- I think most people should use shortcodes, but there are also valid cases for picking MDX. 
- ### Defining Shortcodes
- The earliest instance I can find of Shortcodes is in WordPress.
  - Wordpress: [gallery id="123" size="medium"]
  - Dev.to: { % twitter 834439977220112384 % } (remove spaces)
  - Elder.js: {{shortcode foo=""}} optional inner content {{/shortcode}}
- The whole goal is that you can continue writing in standard plain text, but insert special components just by using a special syntax that wouldn't show up in normal writing
  - Shortcodes are the plaintext analog of Web Components - where a `<custom-element>` might extend HTML, shortcodes extend plaintext (typically Markdown). 
- ### Defining MDX
- MDX, introduced in 2018, inverts this model of content vs code. 
  - It renders your markdown as a React component (or Svelte component, with MDsveX), so it is very natural to add more React components inline
  - In my 2020 survey of the React ecosystem, all blogging documentation tools now offer MDX support by default.

- ### Comparing the Two
- #### Portability and Future-proofing
- MDX requires you to use React and a bundler plugin, tying you in to that ecosystem. 
  - Great if you stay within the lines of what they imagine, 
  - problematic if you want something slightly different or need to move off React (you now have to go through and convert all your content)

- Shortcodes are framework and platform agnostic. 
  - This is how I can blog on Dev.to and render on my own site (the inverted POSSE pattern), and have both render correctly in their native environments.
  - Though shortcodes still require a build chain to process them (including injecting scripts if needed), the minimal viable shortcode processor is no more complex than String.replace. 
  - Ultimately, shortcodes are more likely to show graceful degradation

- #### Scope
- MDX has a broader scope than Shortcodes in that it transforms the entire file - meaning that you can (and often should) supply your own versions of markdown components. 
  - This is handy for, for example, adding classes and preload handling to `<a>` tags, or adding hash links and id's to `<h2>` headers like I do on my blog.
- Shortcodes are limited to their immediate responsibility area - starting and ending with the brackets that designate them.
- #### Customizability
- With MDX, you can compose components as freely as you do JSX
- Shortcodes require you to predefine all the components you are going to use up front. 
  - If you'd like to add a new type of component, you'll have to jump out of your writing mode, go add some code to your components folder, and then jump back in to keep writing.
- #### WYSIWYG
- This is a minor point, but the fact that everything in markdown corresponds to a visible rendered element is a nice correspondence. 
- MDX breaks this by having `import` and `export` statements that compile away to nothing. 
- In practice this is no big deal but it slightly rankles me.

- ### Conclusion
- I think most developer bloggers spring for MDX because they enjoy using JSX, but they end up using the same 3-4 components on every single post or document they write. 
  - In those scenarios, they are accepting the downsides of MDX, without really benefiting from the customizability.
- However, there are still valid usecases of MDX.
  - For a design system or frontend component library, one might argue that MDX allows you to display the exact components 
  - Storybook's **Component Story Format** also provides a nice convention that keeps your documentation agnostic of MDX.
- Because MDX compiles to a React component, you could build tooling that can typecheck MDX
  - The same is doable for shortcodes, but since there is very little restriction on how shortcodes are processed, it is far less likely that successful shared tooling will arise.

- Finally, there's the question of customization. 
  - If you need to compose components inline as you write, then MDX is unquestionably the right choice. 
  - This is why Hashicorp went with MDX

- Perhaps a third "alternative" to Shortcodes vs MDX is structured content - discrete "blocks" of content rendered inside of a CMS, like you see in Notion, Sanity.io or in WordPress Gutenberg. 
  - I don't have a lot of personal experience with this, but my sense is that it locks you in to these systems, in exchange for WYSIWYG and no-code editing. 
  - In a way, structured content is what would happen if your writing is entirely made up of data inside shortcodes.

- ## Markdown编辑器 做成 WYSIWYG（所见即所得）形式会不会有什么弊端？
- https://www.zhihu.com/question/47789842
- 这取决于你如何看待 Markdown：
  - 一个方便生成 HTML 的工具，及其使用的「纯文本精简版 HTML」语法。
  - 一套用纯文本表达语义的语法，以及将使用这种语法的文档转换为实际表现的工具
  - 前者：并没有什么弊端。因为 Markdown 只是用来减少按键数的，关注的是最终的显示结果，而非 Markdown 文档本身。
  - 后者：弊端太明显了，这样的编辑器根本不是 Markdown 编辑器，而是借用了 Markdown 语法的所见即所得的 HTML 编辑器。Markdown 本身就是可以给人看的，转换为 HTML 并不是必须的步骤。typora 这样的所见即所得把 Markdown 本身当作「不必要的细节」处理了。

- ## How should markdown be saved and rendered?
- https://dev.to/michael/how-should-markdown-be-saved-and-rendered-51f
- All the responses here are right, and I definitely would stress @mortoray's point
  - There's a general rule for for asset transformation: **always keep the original** 
  - I like to think of the HTML as a function of the markdown. 
  - Every time the markdown changes, run the function to output HTML. 
  - Within the main function are a series of other functions to handle each subtask and return the latest state of the HTML. 
  - I think the functional approach makes the process easy to modify and reason with.
- Storing as markdown keeps a lot of flexibility for later. 
  - In particular it lets you alter the design. 
  - HTML is overly structured and too strict to be design-change friendly. 
  - Many simple design changes would require altering the HTML, not just the CSS. 
  - IF you keep the markdown, the true source, it's easy enough to render new HTML.

- [How would you store Markdown?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/iwvjse/how_would_you_store_markdown/)
- It's just text, store it in a text field.

- [What is the best way to store a field that supports markdown in my database when I need to render both HTML and “simple text” views?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17250972)
- Decide like this:
  - Store the original data (text with markdown).
  - Generate the derived data (HTML and plaintext) on the fly.
  - Measure the performance:
    - If it's acceptable, you're done, woohoo!
    - If not, cache the derived data.
- Caching can be done in many ways... 
  - you can generate the derived data immediately, and store it in the database, 
  - or you can initially store NULLs and do the generation lazily (when and if it's needed). 
  - You can even cache it outside the database.
  - But whatever you do, make sure the cache is never "stale" - i.e. when the original data changes, the derived data in the cache must be re-generated
  - One way to do that is via triggers.
- just store the data as HTML in the database and then process it to turn it into plain text. In my opinion there are some downsides to that:
  - You will likely need application code to strip the HTML and extract the plain text.
  - Processing the HTML blob can be slow.
  - HTML parsers don't always work well/they can be complex. 
- I would propose what most email providers do:
  - Store a rich text/HTML version and a plain text version. Two fields in the database.
  - As is the use case with email providers, the users might want those two fields to have different content.
  - You can write a UI function that lets the user enter in HTML and then transforms it via the application into a plain text version. This gives the user a nice starting point and they can massage/edit the plain text version before saving to the database.
  - 可参考gmail，可以切换标准视图 和 简单视图，注意是邮件网站自身变简单了，邮件内容还是很花哨但很慢、简单了一点
- Always store the source, in your case it is markdown.
  - You may need it for various purpose, e.g. the same input can be edited, audit trail, debugging etc etc.
- Also store the formats that are frequently used.
  - No overhead for processor/ram if the same format is frequently requested, you are trading it with the disk storage which is cheap comparing to the formars.
- Use on demand conversion/rendering for less frequent used formats.
  - Occasional overhead

- ## Need to fetch markdown from remote source via getInitialProps NextJs
- https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/789
- Fetching remote Markdown is something that an application I am working on needed to do as well. 
  - Using `@mdx/runtime` as the example posted by @millette is the same approach we ended up using 
  - and it has been effective for **returning compiled JSX to react** for render to the page.

```JSX
import Link from 'next/link'
import MDX from '@mdx-js/runtime'
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'

const FrontPage = ({ MDXContent }) => (
  <MDXProvider>
    <div>
      <p>Hello <Link href="/p2"><a>Earth</a></Link></p>
      <MDX>{MDXContent}</MDX>
    </div>
  </MDXProvider>
)

FrontPage.getInitialProps = async ({ req }) => {
  // console.log('FrontPage.getInitialProps') // , a, b, c)
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/c1.txt')
  const c = await res.text()
  // console.log('CCC', c)
  // return { MDXContent: '### more stuff' }
  return { MDXContent: c }
}

export default FrontPage
```

- ## neither Markdown nor atJSON is good for collaborative editing; can't merge changes from multiple actors
- https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1453008693440749584
  - I've been working w/ folks at Ink&Switch on extending the Automerge CRDT to support formatted text, maybe could help w/ use cases like this
- I think there's kind of a tipping point between, say, Obsidian vs (Roam and Notion) -- strongly delineated blocks seem probably better for org-mode type stuff than free-flowing documents, but also aren't as great for writing long documents

- ## atjson is great but the spec should be much more precise. 
- https://twitter.com/nichtich/status/1387301823762079745
  - Writing specs is not easy, it took years to get a good spec of Markdown with CommonMark
- atjson isn't really a spec; there's space for someone with the energy to do that to go ahead and standardise something, but so far we've just built a tool that meets our needs. I think it's a good approach, and @codexeditor independently came up with almost the same thing
- One of the differences to conmonmark is that it's more of an approach. The spec is: here's some Unicode text, here are some annotations on that text (standoff per codex). Annotations have a type, start and end indexes, and a set of type-specific attributes. That's really it!

- ## At @liveblocks , we've exploring different ways to render streaming markdown. 
- https://x.com/nayajunimesh/status/1953471816845918583
  - I've been experimenting with an approach where you only ever enqueue a fully parsed/formed token so you never see an incorrect or partial markdown.
  - In the video, only a fully formed block token is sent to the client for rendering, but we could also be more granular and send fully parsed inline tokens. We could even combine optimistic markdown parsing with this buffering approach for ambiguous markdown elements e.g. links.
  - @ShopifyDevs published an article about a similar approach in 2023! - they call it 'selective markdown buffering'.
  - Rendering markdown stream can be tricky. Most open source solutions append the incoming chunk to the previous chunks and re-parse the entire markdown string. 
  - 💡 A more optimal solution is to maintain a buffer of unparsed markdown and only re-parse that buffer string.
  - In the video, I also parse and sanitize the markdown on server and perform syntax highlighting on server, which helps with security and offloads some heavy work from client
  - @ChromiumDev published an article recently that talks about best practices. [Best practices to render streamed LLM responses  |  Chrome for Developers _202501](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/render-llm-responses)

- ## We’re exploring ways to improve how Markdown is rendered in our components during streaming.
- https://x.com/marcbouchenoire/status/1953123423359541670
  - Complete partial syntax when possible (bold, links, table headers, …)
  - Buffer incomplete elements (partial images, broken emojis, …)
  - `<AiChat />` from `@liveblocks` will have this out-of-the-box, but we’ll also look into releasing it as a standalone package.

- we had a similar issue. solved by using a custom render using markdoc https://markdoc.dev . it also allowed us to stream stream component while showing a loading/fallback

  - Markdown parsing has lots of edge cases so it might be best as more shadcn style (copy and modify for your use case)

- [Sidekick’s Improved Streaming Experience - Shopify _202308](https://shopify.engineering/sidekicks-improved-streaming)
  - how Shopify's Sidekick solves markdown rendering jank and response delay in LLM chatbots with buffering parser and async content resolution.
  - Markdown, as a means of transporting structure, beats JSON and YAML in token counts. And it’s human-readable.

- a TransformStream acts as mdast parser is good for this, but emoji things are really hard to deal

- It’s hard 
  - Generally you either have to re-render the markdown content with each new token (expensive at 60+ tkps) or debounce it or handle it a line at a time 
  - Gets worse if you need multi line code blocks with syntax highlighting, you have to memo the shit out of it

- I wrote a backend MarkdownStreamer that won't flush chunks inside of certain fences to frontend until they're complete.  It only covers the important use cases for us.

- Here’s a processor that converts a markdown stream to an HTML stream on the fly: https://github.com/rossrobino/robino/blob/main/packages/md/README.md#renderstream
  - This way you don’t have to ship your markdown parser to the client, instead just stream HTML directly.

- ## [Don't use marked - macwright.com _202401](https://macwright.com/2024/01/28/dont-use-marked)
- In my mind, there are a few high priorities for Markdown parsers:
  - Security: `marked` isn’t secure by default. Yes, you can absolutely run `DOMPurify` on its output, but will you forget?
  - Standards: it’s nice to follow Commonmark 
  - Performance: Markdown rendering probably isn’t a bottleneck for your application, but it shouldn’t be.

- Marked is pretty performant, but it’s not secure, it’s doesn’t follow a standard - we can do better!
  - micromark: the “micro” Markdown parser primarily by wooorm, which is tiny, follows Commonmark. It’s great. Solid default.

- ## 🆚 [Remark vs MarkdownIt · benrbray/noteworthy _202106](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy/discussions/16)
  - I'm really curious about the reason why you switch the markdown parser to remark from markdown-it.

- I chose markdown-it at first since it seems to be the de-facto standard for Markdown syntax extensions.
  - Noteworthy originally used Marijn's proof-of-concept markdown conversion code to convert the `markdown-it` token stream to a `ProseMirror` document. I hacked on a few extra features but I knew I'd have to eventually rewrite it from scratch, which gave me an opportunity to evaluate if `markdown-it` was the best choice.
- The main reasons I switched:
  - `markdown-it` prioritizes HTML output, while `remark` has first-class support for abstract syntax trees. Having clean ASTs to work with on the backend makes it much simpler to examine / transform Markdown documents in various ways
  - I considered writing a library to convert the `markdown-it` token stream to/from an AST, but decided against it, since many existing syntax extensions don't produce tokens that would be easy to consume. Some of them go direct to HTML without even generating tokens!
  - I found the syntax-extension authoring experience for markdown-it to be too confusing / complicated.
  - `remark` has a very well-specified process for converting `Markdown -> AST -> HTML`.
- There are a few cons, but so far I'm much happier using remark.
  - Remark is relatively young, so the API is a bit unstable 
  - Writing syntax extensions involves manually writing a state machine. 

- Taking a look at your docs, I think we share the common goal of being plugin-driven, and it looks like you're quite far ahead of me with plugin support. I'd be interested to hear about any lessons learned setting up your plugin system.
  - Noteworthy currently takes inspiration from remirror's plugin system for defining schema extensions, and for Markdown parser extensions I let plugins define transformations between the mdast and ProseMirror tree formats.
- In fact milkdown take everything as an Atom. So a prosemirror node as actually an atom. The core part of milkdown just load the atom one by one, and I provide some internal atoms such as parser and serializer, and I also provide some helpers for users to quickly create their own atoms, such as createProsemirrorPlugin
  - All atoms will share a common context, they can read and write properties on it. So as you can imagine, a Paragraph atom will add a node to node list on context. And later, a ProsemirrorSchema atom will use the node list to create a prosemirror schema. This sequence is controlled by LoadState, which has a more clear description in this document page

- I've spent the bulk of my career on content-driven apps, ranging from basic CMS systems to platforms that manage workflow of large, complex, legal documents. 
  - And I can tell you that while Markdown works for basic formatting of short documents, it falls short when you work with people whose entire lives revolve around long documents with complex formatting. (Attorneys, policy writers, etc.) 
  - A UX that exposes markdown to that crowd just isn't widely accepted. 
  - And that is before we even get into actual features like TOCs, headers, pagination, margin control, nested tables, etc.
  - Now, the benefits of Markdown listed in the article are all true -- but also only loosely tied to the UX of the actual document authors and editors.

- I've tried to switch to Markdown almost completely for portability, but I end up having to return to Word frequently to accomplish certain features. IMO, Markdown's biggest flaw was that the original feature set was incomplete, and everyone has tried to fill in the gaps (TOC, tables, references, etc.) their own way instead of settling on an updated standard.

- MS Word really has some features that are missing that would be needed for a markdown editor to make a dent in what we need.
  1. auto-generating table of contents
  2. easy table creation/manipulation
  3. header/footer and page numbering
  4. comments/edits (maybe integrated with git?)

  - 而如今正是 Language Server Protocol 逐步抹平语言差异、统一底层框架的时代，那何不为 Markdown 写一个 language server，实现可以在不同编辑器环境下通用的双向链接语法提示器呢？
- 虽然有了想法，但由于时间、技术力的限制，始终没有动手。
  - 好在一年多以后的今天，终于通过一篇博客发现有人做出了这个东西，那就是 Marksman。
  - 无需自己动手便获得了想要的东西，不仅如此，自己的理论被证实可行，这让我获得了双份的开心。

- ## FWIW markdown-it doesn't escape single apostrophes [0], and the most performant way than I know to do that in the browser involves using the XMLSerializer thing [1], I think that was only some 20% faster or something.

- ## I like markdown-it plugin: `# A heading {#​id-for-heading}` .
- https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1430458279096893440
  - Alas(不幸的是；哎呀), the available TOC plugins don’t pick up the custom ID. 
  - Thus, I’ll probably need to write my own TOC plugin. 
  - Last time I tried Remark, custom IDs + TOC didn’t work, either.
- AFAIK markdown-it is also the fastest tokenizer (i.e. it's ~easily extendable) for Markdown that we can use in the browser. 
  - markdown-wasm compiles it ~2x faster than that but it doesn't output tokens.
- To make it both more semi-standard and a syntax extension, do something with `remark-directive` , which is the best bet on a generic extension mechanism to markdown: `# heading :attrs{#​id.class title="text"}` .

- micromark’s has three primary goals:
- To allow really complex stuff (e.g., concrete syntax trees) that open up interesting stuff for the future
- to be a better base for remark (and the rest of unified) — it’s architecturally better, more readable/reasonable/powerful, CM and GFM compliant, etc
- to provide an alternative for what most folks think they want out of markdown. 
  - remark and ASTs are powerful but also a bit complex; 
  - folks coming from marked or markdown-it and the like *just* want HTML out (w/ maybe a couple extensions)
- Generating a toc is hard in micromark (it’s build in a way that could be streaming, so it spits out HTML immediately), and easy in an AST (find all headings, get their slugs and text, ...)
  - (also this example was specifically on rehype/hast/html, which is even closer to what people are familiar with, e.g.,  `a` and `h1`, compared to remark/mdast/markdown, which has different link constructs)
- Interesting. Pandoc’s filter system supports multiple passes. Especially for TOCs that’s a very clean approach.
  - Yeah, that’s intentionally, those filters are closer to the AST stuff that unified does. micromark doesn’t have an AST; it’s straight to HTML (or to an AST), exactly for people that don’t need multiple passed!
- If I were to add a TOC to micromark, I’d:
  1. Run micromark a first time, collect the headings.
  2. Insert the TOC when running micromark a second time.
- Ah. That might work.
  - micromark is intentionally low-level so there’s no knowledge of a “filename” for a stream/buffer/string. 
  - So assuming multiple files are processed you’d have to track that yourself. But otherwise, that could work!

- ## Joplin Note: Alternative markup like Asciidoc
- https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/alternative-markup-like-asciidoc/2059
- Joplin is really built around Markdown so alternative markups will not be supported. However it might be possible to add the features you need via markdown plugins.
- Yes I see what you mean but this is currently not an objective as it would be complicated to support multiple markups, and it’s not something that we do and it’s done - it’s a lot of complexity that we’ll have to deal with permanently afterwards. It’s not just rendering, there are other parts of the code that expect Markdown. For example:
  - There’s a service that index the resources used by notes - to do that we need to parse the Markdown note.
  - Likewise, there’s a TOC popup that is planned and it will be built based on the markdown text.
  - The search engine indexing most likely will need to be tweaked for each markup.
  - We could have a tool that helps creating Markdown tables.
  - When we import Markdown file, currently we just copy the text to the note. But if we support multiple markup, it would be logical to convert the MD text to the currently active markup.
- Now every time we change something to these parts of the code, it will have to be updated x times, for each supported markup. There are several other examples like this. So that’s why in this case it makes sense to restrict the scope of the project to allow building other useful features.
- Asciidoc is a superset of Markdown, even with flavors, so with a fixed Markdown flavor it is feasible to convert from Markdown to Asciidoc

- ## Reasons to not use Asciidoc as a foundation for a software documentation language__202002
- https://www.eclipse.org/lists/asciidoc-wg/msg00003.html
- After many years using Asciidoc in larger projects, I have come to the conclusion that Asciidoc is not a good foundation for writing technical documentation though. Some reasons are:
1. The syntax is not consistent. There are different syntax constructs for different things. 
  - E.g., setting parameters for certain elements does not follow a single concept. 
  - In some cases a dot is used as prefix, sometimes not, in other cases assignments are used ([.xxx] vs. [xxx] vs. [xxx=yyy]). 
  - And the “+” sign at the end of a line is really a pretty bad idea.
2. The syntax is not intuitive nor readable. 
  - The Github flavored markdown spec contains a nice comparison of Asciidoc vs markdown. 
  - I think the example is self-explaining.
3. There is no clear definition of blocks and nesting. 
  - This makes it really hard for longer texts to write and read. Some things can be nested, others cannot — very confusing.
4. The output cannot be split-up into multiple HTML files. 
  - This is a severe issue when it comes to really long documents, which could easily be the case for specifications. 
  - You can see the difference here: While the first one needs quite some time to load, the latter loads very fast. I wrote the split-up tool myself, see below as well.
5. PDF output is not acceptable. For example, footnotes are not supported. Overall the PDF quality is very poor. 
  - So if you use Asciidoc, you are limited to HTML. 
  - As a site note: Also epub is not supported.
6. Important features for technical documents and specifications are missing, such as special numbered blocks, e.g., for requirements, examples etc. 
  - As a consequence no list of these special blocks, such as list of requirements, list of examples etc., can be created.
7. Linking is an issue. 
  - In particular for documenting software projects, it would be crucial to refer to code (e.g., in the source code repository).
- Issues 4 to 7 may be solved with newly written tools — however that would require a lot of effort, basically writing a new Asciidoc processor from scratch. 
  - But then there are still the issues 1 to 3, which cannot be solved except for simply not using Asciidoc.
- In the Eclipse N4JS project, we have used Asciidoc (and Asciidoctor) for quite some time. 
  - n order to understand why I would not use Asciidoc in the future, simply have a look at some of the Asciidoc sources linked above — they are very hard to read, aren’t they?
- Instead of establishing an AsciiDoc Working Group, I would recommend to establish an (Eclipse) Markdown Working Group
  - Markdown is better readable, and it would be possible (as a working group at Eclipse) to define a defined set of extensions (similar to the Github flavor md), a clear definition of blocks (via indention for example) and other things. 
  - I would strongly recommend to not use Asciidoc as a base for a software documentation language due to the problems described above. 

- ## MyST markdown provides a markdown equivalent of the reStructuredText syntax, meaning that you can do anything in MyST that you can do with reStructuredText
- https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1272744281531285504

- We've been working on a Sphinx extension that lets you write Sphinx docs in 💯 markdown (incl. roles and directives). We call it "MyST Markdown" (for "Markedly Structured Text").
- https://twitter.com/choldgraf/status/1272633413132943360
  - It's the same markdown syntax that jupyter book uses!
- Can you explain on how is it different from m2r extension?
  - it/myst directly parses the markdown into the docutils document structure (what Sphinx uses under the hood). 
  - m2r converts markdown to reStructuredText (rst) and then that gets parsed into docutils structure

- ## HOW TO ESCAPE A BACKTICK WITHIN A CODE BLOCK IN MARKDOWN
- https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2019/05/31/escape-backtick-markdown/
- The first solution to our problem is to use more backticks. 
  - 比如下面顶层使用4个反引号，缺点是默认的格式化工具会打乱格式

~~~~markdown
This is some text

```js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```



```js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

~~~~

- 方法2: using the tilde character

~~~markdown
This is some text

```js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```



```js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

- ## Next.js love MDX, but there are tradeoffs:
- https://twitter.com/ericclemmons/status/1400577327201984517
- hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced
  - deprecated: next-mdx-remote is ~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory issues at scale
- hashicorp/next-mdx-remote
  ✅ get*Props
  ✅ Local/Remote content
  ⚠️ eval
  ❌ No `import` in MDX
- mdxjs.com
  ✅ .mdx pages
  ✅ import Post from "./post.mdx"
  ❌ getStaticProps
  ❌ frontmatter
- xdm might have the right trade offs you need?

- ## Why do bloggers love Markdown? Why use MDX? And other notes from MDXConf_202008
- https://katiekodes.com/why-markdown-mdx-mdxconf/
- Markdown’s main purpose is to make you type less stuff.
- The “MDX library, ” at its core, is a function 
  - that takes an input parameter of a `string` formatted according to the MDX spec
  - and returns a value that’s a `string` formatted according to the JSX spec.

```JS
async function mdx(mdxString) {
  // The "processor" is the thing capable of building a JSX string out of an MDX string
  const processor = ...STUFF - HERE... // Uses the "unified" package
    const file = await processor.process(mdxString)
  return file.contents
}
```

- Do I even want a JSX string?
  - NO
  - I’m just looking for “shortcuts” to blocks of HTML.
  - JSX might be overkill where a bunch of extra objects within a CMS and some static site generator templating would do.

- Yes: CMS previews
  - some CMSes are React apps
  - the same codebase is used twice for both the CMS and the SSG.

- Yes: slight tweaks to the Markdown interpreter
  - highlight code of line 10-13

- Yes: nestable Markdown
  - import md from another-md
  - import component/data/meta from anthor-md

- Maybe: actual React app websites
- Maybe: templating portability
- Maybe: laziness(borrow people's components/)

- ## On the limits of MDX_202002
- https://www.knutmelvaer.no/blog/2020/02/on-the-limits-of-mdx/
- I don't think MDX should be “considered harmful”, nor that everyone should stop using it. 
- But I think there are some things worth considering before locking your, or rather, others’ content to it. 
- Markdown's key feature though, is "easy-to-read, easy-to-write"

- What is the problem MDX tries to solve?
  - Markdown was designed at a time where most of the web authoring was still done in HTML.
  - Web content has moved towards a much richer set of components, from embeds to interactive codeblocks, to between-paragraphs call to actions.
  - MDX seems like an attempt to make these components available to the author in the same syntax used in frontend development 
- But this problem has been solved already. 
  - With something they call “rich text editors”
  - There's plenty of content platforms with plenty of rich text editors that spews out plenty of different formats, including markdown, HTML, and abstractions as MobileDoc and Portable Text. 
  - medium, notion...
  - Arguably, these interfaces are more friendly and more accessible than learning Markdown, or MDX.
- when I have been made to write MDX.
  - mess the syntax up all the time
  - No syntax highlighting
  - No helpful error
  - I had to actually look up a bunch of documentation just to make a code exampe or a “note”

- Writing with a markup syntax should be opt-in, not forced upon you.

- For most uses of MDX, you will end up mixing specific presentation concerns with your content. This is not great.
  - Yeah, it kinda worked for HTML. 
  - 若像html一样定制样式后，mdx代码会凌乱不堪，html代码也很乱
- For people working with content strategy, content is best stored as ingredients from which you can bake the things that you need when you need it.
  - They have been preaching “structured content” for ages, and fighting with CMSes that force content into WYSIWYG page builders and make editors copy-paste their texts around in small layout boxes prisons.
- You should think really hard about how you want to be able to work with your content, the inclinations of whom you want to work with your content, and finally, how sustainable and flexible your structuring of it is.
