- I think this is the strategy used by @GoodNotesApp for their lines (which are great btw). Those look like globs to me. 👀 And they erase well—glob by glob.
- The first challenge: the points of a glob need to be far enough away from each-other to allow us to draw tangents between them. (If the handles end up inside of the circles, the glob breaks.) We'll need to lose points, but we still may need those points to inform the curve.
- TIL about Glob! Thinking of using them in your drawing tool? What's the application? Other than being somehow adorable
  - Yeah, I think we can link them together to create dynamic lines! (Also, you can spin those circles and curves if you want to try this in 3D! See the link at the bottom of the demo.)
