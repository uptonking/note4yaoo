- ## [v6 Comparison with approach of react-simple-code-editor_201907](https://github.com/codemirror/dev/issues/109)

- ## Does anybody need a new code editor for the web that's 2x faster than Monaco, 10x smaller than CodeMirror, and works well on mobile?
- https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1618807374973911046
  - I'm syntax highlighting with the CSS Custom Highlight API, which hasn't shipped elsewhere yet. 

- highlight.js supports rendering to string plugins (the library “marked” uses it) but lacks the line numbers for it
  - I think Highlight.js isn't appropriate for this use case, it doesn't support tokenizing incrementally so it would block the main thread, potentially for multiple seconds for large files, and it doesn't support TextMate grammars, so the syntax highlighting will be sub-par.
- https://copenhagen.autocode.com 1/50 the size of Monaco, with most of the features.
  - It may be the best of its kind that I've seen so far. 
  - Mine uses TextMate grammars so syntax highlighting should be higher quality and smoother. And while scrolling it does ~5x less work (~10x less if we only look at the JS portion). It's  just PoC for now though.
- On a closer inspection Copenhagen seems to weigh 1/9th the size of Monaco (~190kb), not 1/50th. Like the instance of Monaco that I use is ~1.7MB, not ~10MB.And editing doesn't seem to work on mobile for me.Still interesting though.
- What grammar do you end up? tree-sitter? Also, is it canvas2d?
  - I'm using TextMate grammars at the moment, but I want to eventually add support for something else to it, like Monarch grammars, as otherwise it won't be 10x smaller than CM. No canvas, pure DOM.
- Can you use tree sitter for highlighting and ide like features?
  - Maybe in the future, it's very much a work in progress thing right now, currently only a TextMate-based syntax highlighter is supported.
- I think also http://repl.it also was working on something similar.
  - I think they are happy with CodeMirror, which is a fine choice

## CRDTs & Positions in CodeMirror 6__202008

- https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/crdts-positions-in-codemirror-6/2571
- ProseMirror and CodeMirror 6 now both implement a similar approach for transforming positions. 
  - From a developer experience, this is great. This allows third-party plugins to provide features such as commenting on ranges of the document to unique map positions while accounting for remote changes.
- the current position mapping approach is unsuitable for yjs/CRDT-bindings to *Mirror editors. So third-party plugins won’t work with CRDT approaches to provide shared editing.

- I think there are several good arguments to reconsider using a CRDT for shared editing in CodeMirror.
  - Better position handling
  - The author of ShareJS and ShareDB openly speaks out against OT: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24194091
  - The web has evolved to a point where web applications do work peer-to-peer over WebRTC. One of many real-world examples is room.sh 13. They use Yjs & CodeMirror 5 to provide collaboration in peer-to-peer WebRTC sessions.

- My goal is to power shared editing on the web with Yjs. Different editors can use the same technology to provide shared editing over different backends. 
- I think the Y. Text type would be a great data model for CodeMirror 6. 
  - If you are interested, I’d love to help you to integrate the Y. Text type into CodeMirror 6 and work with you on a better approach for position mapping. 
  - Another advantage of Yjs is that it supports selective Undo/Redo for free (no additional data structure to hold operations, just ranges on the vector clocks).
- Alternatively, it would be helpful if CodeMirror 6 would allow CRDT editor bindings to hijack position mappings. 
  - Although, as you explained, index positions don’t always accurately describe ranges in collaborative documents. 
  - With CRDTs, it is possible to refer to deleted characters. This is not possible if positions are described as index positions. With any change around the mapped position, some information gets lost. 
- Another alternative is to abstract positions in CodeMirror. 
  - A CRDT implementation could add markers to the abstract position to describe the position relative to the CRDT model without doing index transformations (i.e. map to the unique ID of the character).

- I just realized that the example in your blog post shows that positions in OT also don’t always converge. This was surprising to me. 
  - I’m currently educating people using y-prosemirror not to use the default position mapping because they don’t work in peer-to-peer scenarios. 
  - If this is the expected behavior for CodeMirror & ProseMirror, I can be more lenient(宽容的) to the fact they they also don’t converge with Yjs.
  - Although, I still think that in some cases this behavior is not acceptable. For example when implementing a shared-cursor plugin, or when implementing a commenting plugin.

- If it was possible to hijack the position mapping and provide a custom mapping based on the CRDT model, it would be possible to have positions converge.
  - If your input is still a plain (and thus ambiguous in the face of deletions) position, I don’t see how you can provide a better mapping. A position next to a deletion will correspond to multiple CRDT character IDs, and you don’t have information to disambiguate that.
- You are right… this wouldn’t work either. For the few cases when convergence is required I will provide a different position abstraction that doesn’t need to be native to CodeMirror. Thanks for your feedback.

- ## Meta: Observable editor in observable_201909
- https://talk.observablehq.com/t/meta-observable-editor-in-observable/2376
  - One thing that I would like to do is to create a view with a nice text editor (ideally the same as the one used in observable) where users of my notebook can write some code with another linter (e.g. python) 
- Observable’s editor is based on CodeMirror. There’s a nice and simple example of CodeMirror in this notebook
- [CodeMirror inside of Observable](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/codemirror-inside-of-observable)
  - We use CodeMirror to power a lot of the editing abilities of Observable, but we can also embed CodeMirror inside of a notebook to provide an in-notebook editing experience.

- ## codemirror 6 
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26039111
- One of the things I was hoping to see in this release was first-class LSP (language server protocol) support.
  - Sorbet (Ruby type checker) implements the LSP protocol and can be compiled to WASM
  - I'm especially excited to see mobile support as a headline feature, because that's completely lacking in Monaco. 
  - Maybe LSP support can be a future improvement.
- There's still no way to use create-react-app with monaco out of the box with offline support (@monaco-editor/react includes calls to a CDN instead of using the bundled JS).

- ## codemirror6: Decide how to distribute/manage CSS_201812
- https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next/issues/40
- Connecting modules to the CSS they rely on doesn't seem to be a solved problem in the JS ecosystem yet. Our plugins will often need a few lines of CSS to work. Requiring people to manually add `<link>` tags for each of those (which come from NPM and are probably not even in their web root by default) is a poor user experience.
  - I'm also not partial to schemes that inject the CSS into the page at run-time. When users are optimizing their page, they'd prefer to have control over how and when CSS is loaded, and not have that done at unpredictable moments by a script.
  - Who knows any existing approaches that we could take inspiration from?
- making it easy to write themes that integrate with the various plugins would be an advantage. 
  - This is one reason current codemirror.css defines all kinds of non-core styles—themes will want to include all of those as well.
- FWIW I took a stab a creating an Ubuntu theme package for CodeMirror 6. It was fun! The biggest difference from CM5 is having to deal with native selections, which can be styled with ::selection.
  - The main suggestion I have after doing this is to more clearly separate the "core" CSS (required for correct layout) vs. "theme" CSS (that sets colors).
  - Regarding distribution, my gut feeling is that well organized plain old CSS would be best.
- Being a packaged component, we have somewhat different requirements than what most CSS-in-JS/CSS modules libraries are written for.
  - I was somewhat attracted to the idea of making all styles inline at first, since it nicely avoids the problem of having to create `<style>` tags and CSS rules at all, but that will often create really ugly DOM, and (more importantly) makes it impossible to support things like pseudo-classes and media queries, so I think we don't want that.
  - The alternative is to provide a way for scripts to generate class names from descriptions, and directly use those class names in the DOM. That doesn't work very well for highly dynamic CSS, but I guess the bulk of our CSS will fit the pattern just fine, and we can fall back to the `style` attribute for the rest.
- I was also working with styled-components for the past few days (I'm making a file tree component with react-virtualized).
  - I dropped CSSinJS at least for this case where performance IS the core component of the thing.
- Functional CSS makes the DOM directly reference the style. This works fine if you're in full control of the website, but a reusable component that wants to allow outside styling can't do that.
- style-module is much like a classical CSS module library, but works with sets of classes, rather than individual classes.
  - https://github.com/marijnh/style-mod
  - The idea behind that is that a plugin would define its styling as a style module containing classes for all the styleable elements it creates, and export that module. 
  - Client code can then extend this module and pass it back to the plugin as part of a configuration. 
  - If all plugins make sure they do this, and use the configured style module (with their own base module as a fallback) when styling, that should help with the overriding problem (without relying on side effects or global scopes).
  - The editor view itself would use a similar mechanism to allow the editor to be themed.

- ## We are rewriting CodeMirror_201808
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17858672
- Now I use Monaco aka Visual Studio Code. 
  - What would CodeMirror offer ? 
  - With Monaco I get all the lastest feature of VSCode . Current versions of Monaco include Intellisense etc.
  - I'm honestly curious both what CodeMirror will offer and why even try to compete. 
- CodeMirror aims to be slimmer, and less of a cut-off piece of vs code. I also think our API is more well designed and expressive. And, as Adrian mentioned below, though he got downvoted, CodeMirror works on phones
  - The fact that it works on mobile is the biggest advantage imho. We use it for that reason.
- monaco doesn't even try to work on mobile browsers.
