- ## [CodeMirror 6: Web-Worker-isolated state? _202012](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/codemirror-6-web-worker-isolated-state/2788)
- Considering V6’s singleton and isolated state, I think it’s possible to ‘decouple’ the EditorView instance from it’s state and instead dispatch updates through some asynchronous helper functions. 
  - I wish to do this because, well, it’s fun, and also because I’m doing some fairly heavy lifting on the DOM on the main thread (very, very fast Markdown live-preview, which itself is already heavily web-workerized and asynchronous) and I would like to isolate the potentially parse-heavy operations into a web-worker.
  - I know that monaco-editor already does this, so it would be a ‘competitive’ feature to have or have easily supported.
- Not doing this is a conscious decision in this project—serializing/deserializing on worker boundaries is very limiting in the kind of data structures you can (effectively) use, 
  - and asynchronicity everywhere makes code a lot more complex, expensive, and error-prone. 
  - So I went with a synchronous single-heap approach that takes care not to do too much work during updates.

- ## [Spike(尖钉；尖刺): Investigate CodeMirror as a replacement for Monaco · GitLab.org/GitLab _202301](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387586)
- Monaco has served us well as a foundation for the Source Editor for the past couple of years. But some changes to our overall tech stack and the direction of our other categories warrant re-visiting the underlying editor for Source Editor.
  - Monaco continues to lack basic support for touchscreen devices. 
  - The Content Editor is maturing and the underlying combination of Tiptap and ProseMirror is proving to be a viable foundation for future development. We are looking to increase the usage of Content Editor in 2023 and it's possible that adopting CodeMirror could simplify the transition between the two editors in places where they co-exist.
  - The Web IDE Beta has moved away from Monaco in favor of a custom fork of VS Code. Without the need for the Source Editor to power this more demanding area of the product, we should re-consider what it needs to do everywhere else and determine which platform best meets our needs.

- considering the PoC for consolidating SE and CE (video), I think the value and urgency of this issue should be lowered. We can get to it eventually, but it should not be seen as a helper or blocker for x-editors' communication.
  - 100% agreed. I only see mobile support as a key differentiator and that may actually be in a better place than we assumed.

- ## [sourcegraph: Migrating from Monaco Editor to CodeMirror _202210](https://sourcegraph.com/blog/migrating-monaco-codemirror)
  - 主要考虑可定制性、体积

- We recently migrated Sourcegraph.com away from Monaco, the code editor component that powers VS Code, to CodeMirror. 
- TL; DR
  - Monaco gives you a lot out of the box, but it’s pretty hard to configure or trim down on features you don’t need.
  - Monaco’s documentation is not great, so we couldn’t always figure out if it was possible to make it do what we needed.
  - Monaco has a global reference model, which makes it tricky to run several instances of it on the same page with small configuration differences.
  - In terms of code size, Monaco accounted for a whopping 40% of our external dependencies.
  - CodeMirror has already been adopted by other large projects such as Replit and Chrome’s developer tools, indicating that it isn’t going to disappear any time soon.
- We’re still getting to know CodeMirror, but so far it has solved all of the above problems and has been delightful to use. It’s been the default component for our search input since May 2022, and we’ll be using it for a lot more in future releases of Sourcegraph

- Although similar, in many ways CodeMirror turned out to be the exact opposite of Monaco. 
  - Monaco gives you a full IDE by default. This includes a multi-line editor, and a code “minimap”
  - CodeMirror is more minimalist and modular. You don’t get as much by default, but you can build exactly what you want by adding and configuring various components. 

- The problems we had with Monaco and how CodeMirror fixed them
- Size: Monaco pushed the amount of JavaScript code that we download on our search page to 6MB.
- Single-line editor: Unlike most IDEs, our search input is a single-line input… most of the time.
- CSS integration: To customize the look of Monaco, we had to hard-code hex color codes into our JavaScript instead of being able to use our site-wide CSS classes and variables.
- Global configuration: It’s tricky to render several Monaco instances per page, each with a slightly different configuration.
- Placeholder text: There has been a long-standing open issue with Monaco requesting a feature to enable a placeholder or default value.
- Code cleanliness: We had some nasty hacks to make Monaco do what we wanted it to.

- We can do a lot more with CodeMirror
- Rewriting our file viewer using CodeMirror
  - For historical reasons, we weren’t using any code editor for this file-view functionality. It’s a read-only view
  - we do need a lot of the same functionality when displaying files, including syntax highlighting, line numbers, and code navigation.
  - Another advantage of using a code editor for a file viewer is apparent when viewing large files. When opening a file with thousands or millions of lines, a code editor like CodeMirror won’t load and render an entire file. Instead, it intelligently only renders what’s on the user’s screen.

- ## 🆚️📝 [Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A Comparison of the Code Editors You Use in the Browser __202112](https://blog.replit.com/code-editors)

- [「译」Ace，CodeMirror 和 Monaco：Web 代码编辑器的对比 - Xheldon Blog](https://www.xheldon.com/tech/a-comparison-of-code-editor.html)

- I’ve been working on Replit for roughly six years now, and as the team has grown, I’ve focused on the IDE (what we call the workspace) portion of the product. 
  - Naturally, I was increasingly preoccupied with the code editor. 
  - While we’ve considered creating a code editor that meets our needs, the complexity involved in developing one, the richness of open-source choices available, and the size of our staff made it a fruitless rabbit hole to enter. Our time is best spent elsewhere.
  - I have had the pleasure (and the pain) of using Ace, Monaco, and CodeMirror in production
- In the early days of Replit, around 2011, there was no code editor. It was a pure REPL interface, a console with a simple input box. 
  - Code editors give us features like syntax highlighting, editor shortcuts, auto-indentation, search and replace, etc. 
  - Cloud9 released Ace at the time as a feature-full, performant web code editor. 
- 🎯 We used Ace until around late 2017 when we switched to Monaco. 
  - While Ace was still being maintained, only one person was working on it. After Amazon acquired Cloud9, it appeared as though they deprioritized the open-source project.
  - The editor was not receiving as many updates, issues were racking up on GitHub, and the maintainers added almost no features.
- Monaco is the editor that powers VSCode; 
  - If we switch to Monaco, we thought we’d be able to get all the cool updates and features from the good folks working on VSCode.
  - Switching came at a cost, it was missing a lot of Ace’s features, but we were confident that it would surpass Ace in no time with the community’s excitement and contributions
  - The first issue was that there were a lot of languages modes missing from Monaco
  - Another problem with Monaco was the build tooling. I had to precompile Monaco as a Webpack DLL and add many Webpack configurations to make it work.
- 🎯 Unfortunately, Monaco also didn’t have an easy way to lazy-load modules and do code-splitting, so it was tough to get small bundle sizes. It added a whopping 5 megabytes (uncompressed) to our workspace bundle, and that’s not something we take lightly.
  - Monaco also doesn’t work well on mobile. 
  - we wound up with two code editors on Replit: one for desktop computers and one for mobile. Every new feature had to be ported over to Ace (mobile). We had to write a language client for Ace for LSP features, and we had to write an operational transformation adapter for Ace to support multiplayer, and so on.
- 🎯 In late 2018 Marijn announced a rewrite for CodeMirror to modernize the editor, CodeMirror version 6 with an excellent design doc. 
  - **One of the primary motivators for the rewrite was adding support for touch devices**. 
  - CodeMirror would achieve that by leaning on native browser text editing (via contentEditable) rather than implementing text editing entirely in the library/javascript.
  - ProseMirror inspired CodeMirror 6’s API design
  - we started to adopt CodeMirror incrementally. We first added it as the defacto read-only editor on Replit, then started adding it to different parts of the website where the code gets edited.

- 🆚️ 比较项目
  - Stability
  - Out of the box experience
  - Modularity, bundling, and footprint
  - Extensibility and advanced features
  - Community and documentation.
  - Performance
  - Mobile support

- If you want a code editor that supports mobile, you should use CodeMirror 6. 
  - Ace has not-bad support but does not come close, and Monaco is unusable on mobile.
  - I'd go as far as saying that CodeMirror is probably suitable even for native applications as a `webview` component. 
  - Most things in CodeMirror are serializable so you can interop with the webview from your native code.

- ## 👥 [Ace, CodeMirror, and Monaco: A comparison of browser code editors (2021) | Hacker News _202203](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30673759)
- CodeMirror improved Replit's performance by a lot and by extension our retention. In fact, after releasing it to mobile in July our weekly retention rate on mobile increased by a whopping 70%. 
- CodeMirror has a brilliant story for realtime collaborative editing. You have two options: OT vs YJS
  - We had to handroll our own OT implementation inhouse (based on https://github.com/ottypes/text-unicode) since we had built the system for it already. I suspect we would've used or forked CodeMirror's collab package if we were starting today.
- The article calls CodeMirror "lightweight" but the minified JS is still over 1 MB. If you want lightweight then you probably want something like CodeJar (https://github.com/antonmedv/codejar) which clocks in at 2 kB.

- The killer app for cloud IDEs is honestly going to be something GitHub code navigation. Imagine being able to do PRs with click to definition, find all references, etc., without having to pull in the changes locally. It's also great even right now for reading open source projects when you are trying to understand how something works.
  - They are great for viewing code, but I'm not convinced they are good for writing code.
- The closest is to press ".", or change url from github.com to github.dev. That opens up the github repo in a VScode/Monaco editor

- Cloud IDEs are the modern version of using X Windows or RDP/VNC sessions, that is the problem that they solve.

- Mobile support means that CodeMirror 6 is often the only option. I think it's a bit of a waste to start of project with Ace or Monaco, knowing that it will never work in mobile.
  - Ace is not perfect on mobile, but it works to some extent.

- Monaco uses it's own build system that requires a lot of configuration twiddling to get it to work. Powerful, but it's first and foremost built for VSCode.

- Any thoughts on Code Server? It’s vs code in a browser, I’ve been used it for one year now and it’s great. But maybe it’s outside the scope of the article?
  - It's using monaco as the underlying editor, just like VS Code that it's based on. Code Server basically takes the VS Code codebase as is and just adds a very light server layer to do auth and static content serving. All of the frontend javascript code, etc. is the same as the desktop version of VS Code.

  - If anyone is still having problems with this, I was able to create a small demo based on @madebysid comment, you can find it here: https://github.com/okikio/codemirror 197, Demo Link: https://okikio-codemirror.netlify.app/

- For the @codesanbox/sandpack-react package there was a discussion on how to integrate the language server with codemirror.
- I’d like to share the progress I made on integrating the TypeScript LSP into Sandpack, which uses CodeMirror in the editor component. Fortunately, I could implement most of the features I had planned thanks to the amazing examples from @okikio and @madebysid.
- Here’s the full list of feature:
  IntelliSense; 
  Tooltip error; 
  Multiple files; 
  Support tsconfig.json; 
  Automatically dependency-types fetching (CodeSandbox CDN); 
  In-browser dependency cache; 
- TBH, I’m not an expert on CodeMirror even less on LSP, so I’m curious to know how I can improve this implementation and make it even better
  - https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/danilowoz/sandpack-tsserver/tree/main/

- Did https://codesandbox.io/ switch away from CodeMirror to Monaco for it’s TypeScript/LSP editor? If so, is there a discussion somewhere of why? _202212
  - 💡 Actually, CodeSandbox has always used Monaco as the default editor, except for a specific mobile version where we defaulted it to CodeMirror.
- Not to be pedantic, but it’s worth noting that tsserver / the typescript standalone worker is not LSP compatible.
  - Replit is working on open sourcing our LSP Client (we didn’t the microsoft packages) and a follow up to open source the LSP client + codemirror extension. Timeline TBD but should happen in 2023

- We were able to leverage much of the learning discussed here to implement Typescript completions for our open source multiplayer code editor VZCode
- It’s a more bit complex than the examples here because:
  - The system supports editing multiple files
  - The system supports remote collaborators (so their changes need to be accounted on the LSP side for in addition to local changes)
  - There are multiple instances of the CodeMirror extension that talk to a singleton language server
  - The singleton language server lives in a Web worker

- ## 📖📚 [Show HN: Add live runnable code to your dev docs | Hacker News _202204](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31004973)
- Devbook is an SDK that you add to your docs website and then every time a user visits your dev docs, we spin up a VM just for that user. 
  - The VM is ready in about 18-20 seconds. We haven't had enough time to work on optimization but from our early tests, we are fairly confident we can get this to about 1-2 seconds.
  - In the VM you can run almost anything. Install packages, edit & save files, run binaries, services, etc.
  - On the backend, the VM is a Firecracker microVM with our custom simple orchestrator/scheduler built on top that just gets the job done. 
- We chose Firecracker for 4 reasons:
  * (1) the security with a combination of their jailer
  * (2) its snapshotting capabilities
  * (3) quick booting times
  * (4) option to oversubscribe the underlying server resources
- The way Devbook works is that you use our frontend SDK on our website. The SDK pings our backend and we boot up a VM.

- https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker /apache2/202405/rust/python
  - http://firecracker-microvm.io/
  - Firecracker is an open source virtualization technology that is purpose-built for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function-based services that provide serverless operational models. 
  - Firecracker runs workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which combine the security and isolation properties provided by hardware virtualization technology with the speed and flexibility of containers.
  - The main component of Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) to create and run microVMs. 
  - Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to accelerate the speed and efficiency of services like AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate. 

- Very good idea, and you're not alone. The upcoming documentation for React will have a similar feature built on Sandpack
- We've used https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#int... do do this ourselves. No need to use codesandbox.
  - Docusaurus maintainer here. Yes we like MDX and live code blocks to embed natively runnable code in your page. I don't like the idea of loading a remote iframe much (at least for most cases using JS).
  - The StackBlitz / WebContainer approach also seems better than a remote VM + iframe
  - We'll likely use a project called React-Runner in the future, quite similar to our current setup (real native embed) but lighter.

- Since you're using Firecracker, it's hard to understand how it takes 20 seconds to boot a VM. AWS Lambda worst performer (JVM) I think takes much less than that, like 5 seconds in cold start. Why don't you offer warmed VMs? Like reserved concurrency in AWS Lambda. Preemptively increase the number of VMs (like an auto-scaler) as traffic increases.
  - We have a few unoptimized things happening on our infra in the moment. We are working on it to make it better and it will be better soon. Most likely around 1-2 seconds.

- This seems like a great alternative to passing around postman collections separate from documentation

- 🤔 Isn't this something similar to Jupiter Books, where you can have executable code?
  - Devbook allows you to integrate the "interactive code experience" natively into your docs. It's not just embedding an iframe. We can also handle use-cases like CLIs better since you can add a full emulated terminal (like RunOps did on their landing page) to your website and control it with JavaScript.

- Is there a way to declare the code in the backend, instead of the frontend? Declaring the code in the frontend and having the VM execute whatever comes from it is asking for serious abuse.
  - Yes! You can predefine the whole VM with our CLI via a simple Dockerfile

- how about going the opposite way, while staying in your code editor you can interact with some documentation that guides you to integrate with their code
  - Stay tuned to what we are building

- lezer is a parser generator( which by itself is not a trivial feat with novel ideas like incremental computations applied to parsing) to power his mainstream project which is CodeMirror.
- it would be great if CodeMirror could just work with Tree-sitter or similar. There’s a lot of ecosystem around other parsing systems, and needing to figure out Lezer stuff is a big friction for adopting CodeMirror 6 for me. There are not a lot of language packages listed
- Unfortunately, tree-sitter is written in C, which is still awkward to run in the browser (and CodeMirrror targets non-WASM browsers). It also generates very hefty grammar files because it makes the size/speed trade-off in a different way than a web system would.
  - Tree-sitter does run on the web. I got it working for my editor, but it did involve several days' worth of effort and getting into the weeds with emscripten.
- I've been using both codemirror and lezer in Yaade (https://github.com/EsperoTech/yaade). Thanks to lezer I was able to write a JSON extension language that supports Yaade environment variables. Pretty cool project and very nicely documented! I love building OSS on top of OSS.

- ## [Allow alternate editor components: Monaco editor, ACE · executablebooks/thebe _202402](https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe/issues/730)
- The current editor component codemirror from jupyter, has issues with CSS transforms.
  - CSS transforms is used by reveal.js to zoom slides from "design size" to "screen size".
  - This causes codemirror component to be quite unusable within reveal.js slides, as the visible cursor, line indicator and similar can be complely off.

- Apparently @codemirror/view 6.18.0 added some code to detect when the view component is scaled. But Thebe appears to currently use codemirror 5.

- I was just wondering if anyone could tell me if codemirror6 is backwards compatible with JupyterLab3 or will it only work with JupyterLab4?
  - In core, it will only work with JupyterLab 4. It’s possible someone could write an extension that would replace some renderers with codemirror 6 (e.g. notebook cell inputs), but likely not all of them (e.g. settings editor).
  - 💡 There was an attempt to generalize the `ICodeEditor` to allow alternate implementations (e.g. to support monaco integration), but this never really worked out, and supporting two versions of the same library is particularly challenging when the breaking changes are almost total.

- ## 🆚️ [Implementing WYSIWYG Markdown editor in CodeMirror - discuss. CodeMirror _202005](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/implementing-wysiwyg-markdown-editor-in-codemirror/2403)
- Do you think using ProseMirror would be better than hacking CodeMirror to accomplish the same thing?
  - Probably. It’ll definitely involve less fighting against the library.

- I dug into ProseMirror some more and felt like ProseMirror is a better choice for something like this, especially with `NodeView` for editing math and code blocks. By storing the markup in Marks expanding/folding should also be doable.

- ## [Inline Codemirror inside Prosemirror? - discuss. CodeMirror _202311](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/inline-codemirror-inside-prosemirror/7396)
- Yes, it is, there’s even an example like that on the ProseMirror website.

- But I was thinking as an inline node, meaning instead of being a full width div, it just expands as the user types.
  - no, CodeMirror assumes it is a block element, so for this you’d have to wrap it in some kind of `inline-block` container and add a kludge that constantly resizes it to match its content size. It won’t work as a regular content-fitting inline element.

- ## [Synchronising CodeMirror 6 and ProseMirror _202310](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/synchronising-codemirror-6-and-prosemirror/7339)
- Could you offer any advice on how to translate between the CodeMirror and ProseMirror transactions please?
  - Not really. The way you map between rich text and plain text documents is going to involve some kind of translation, I guess, depending on the text format and ProseMirror schema used. You say nothing about how you’re doing that, but I suspect it involves some kind of parsing. Mapping changes in such a context, and especially translating text changes to structured ProseMirror steps is likely going to be non-trivial. It may be easier to compute a diff of some kind and work from that.

- ## 💡 [Switch from Monaco to CodeMirror and generate AST from Lezer tree _202208](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/switch-from-monaco-to-codemirror-and-generate-ast-from-lezer-tree/4946)
  - It seems to me that using Lezer as the parser for CodeMirror is a better option than reusing the Chevrotain parser. I wonder if I should now get rid of the Chevrotain parser completely and generate the AST tree from the Lezer tree? 
- That depends. Lezer does not emit an abstract syntax tree, just a set of nodes with types and parent/child relations. So using that for analysis is definitely possible, but more awkward than what you’d get from a regular parser—you have to iterate through child nodes finding the one you’re interested in, and get the name of variables by reading the start/end position of the corresponding node from the document, and so on.

- Is there a way to serialize and deserialize a Lezer tree (to send it to a worker)?
  - No, that currently doesn’t exist. There’s Tree.build 25 to deserialize from the arrays the parser builds up, but no corresponding serialization function. Also, since these are constantly being updated and share structure with previous trees, you’d probably want something more intelligent than full serialization/deserialization (such as tagging subtrees with IDs using WeakMap so that you can reuse them on the other side when they have already been moved to the worker).

- ## [Anyone Explored a Codemirror 6 Canvas/WebGL Renderer? - discuss. CodeMirror](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/anyone-explored-a-codemirror-6-canvas-webgl-renderer/3779)
- The Bespin 9 project in 2009 worked this way, but was given up due to, I believe, problems with the approach. Some things to keep in mind:
  - In most situations, for text layout, the DOM will be faster than a canvas
  - Accessibility will be terrible if your text is just pixels on a canvas
  - Doing text positioning, styling, and wrapping is a whole lot more difficult with fillText

- I haven’t worked with WebVR—seems like there’s a proposed 8 standard for making it capable of showing regular DOM elements, but nothing actually implemented at the time. I guess as a workaround for that limitation, mirroring a CM instance to a canvas is a more or less reasonable thing to do.

- ## 🆚️ [v6 Comparison with approach of react-simple-code-editor _201907](https://github.com/codemirror/dev/issues/109)
- react-simple-code-editor: works by allowing users to edit inside a native `textarea` , while overlaying syntax-highlighted code on top of it. On the face of it this seems like quite an elegant and simple approach that works well.

- I find myself wondering what makes the more complex approach taken by CodeMirror superior to that approach, which seems so simple by comparison.
- I can only think of the following drawbacks to the approach taken by react-simple-code-editor:
  - Syntax highlight requires a complete parse on each keystroke. This could be addressed by using `tree-sitter` or `lezer` for maintaining the AST.
  - The syntax-highlighted DOM tree is clobbered and regenerated on each keystroke. This could be addressed by using virtual DOM to update the DOM based on the fresh AST (e.g. using preact or react).
  - Really large files would render in full with this approach, whereas CodeMirror only renders what's visible.
- The above problems can be ignored for use cases where the files will not be large, or syntax highlighting is not required when the amount of text is above a certain threshold.
  - I'm posting this issue as a sanity check, to see if I'm missing some important points that make the complex update patterns within CodeMirror inherently a better choice than the approach taken by react-simple-code-editor. 

- This isn't a new idea—it was also the approach used by Editarea, the only halfway serious predecessor of CodeMirror.
  - Can't use anything but single-font single-style text inside the editor or the characters get misaligned.
  - Reading from a textarea is all-or-nothing, so when the document is big, even if you manage to do incremental highlighting, you have to read the entire string and then diff it against the previous value, which is expensive. (Have you tried pasting a big document into their demo? It becomes unusable.)
- In short, most of the features that CodeMirror provides couldn't be built on top of this approach, and forget about scalability. A component like this is perfectly appropriate if you know your snippets are going to be small and you don't need much extra functionality, but doesn't scale beyond that.

- FWIW I came across this video that I found very informative, regarding why CodeMirror operates the way it does: YouTube: Marijn Haverbeke - Grammar-based language modes for text editors. I'm beginning to grok that by comparison, the approach taken by react-simple-code-editor is extremely crude and wasteful of compute resources.
  - Note that the system I describe there never made it into mainstream CodeMirror (though you can use it if you install it separately), and lezer is a new, different approach.

- 🆚️🤔 Actually one of my main questions about Lezer is why not just use tree-sitter, which appears to do the same thing more or less. That could be a good point to address on the Lezer home page (which surprisingly doesn't mention tree-sitter), as many people will probably be wondering the same thing when they discover the project. The point is partially addressed in the README here lezer-parser/lezer , but it requires a lot of the reader to figure out exactly what Lezer has or does, that tree-sitter doesn't.

- ## 🆚️ Does anybody need a new code editor for the web that's 2x faster than Monaco, 10x smaller than CodeMirror, and works well on mobile?
- https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1618807374973911046
  - I'm syntax highlighting with the CSS Custom Highlight API, which hasn't shipped elsewhere yet. 

- highlight.js supports rendering to string plugins (the library “marked” uses it) but lacks the line numbers for it
  - I think Highlight.js isn't appropriate for this use case, it doesn't support tokenizing incrementally so it would block the main thread, potentially for multiple seconds for large files, and it doesn't support TextMate grammars, so the syntax highlighting will be sub-par.
- https://copenhagen.autocode.com 1/50 the size of Monaco, with most of the features.
  - It may be the best of its kind that I've seen so far. 
  - Mine uses TextMate grammars so syntax highlighting should be higher quality and smoother. And while scrolling it does ~5x less work (~10x less if we only look at the JS portion). It's  just PoC for now though.
- On a closer inspection Copenhagen seems to weigh 1/9th the size of Monaco (~190kb), not 1/50th. Like the instance of Monaco that I use is ~1.7MB, not ~10MB. And editing doesn't seem to work on mobile for me. Still interesting though.
- What grammar do you end up? tree-sitter? Also, is it canvas2d?
  - I'm using TextMate grammars at the moment, but I want to eventually add support for something else to it, like Monarch grammars, as otherwise it won't be 10x smaller than CM. No canvas, pure DOM.
- Can you use tree sitter for highlighting and ide like features?
  - Maybe in the future, it's very much a work in progress thing right now, currently only a TextMate-based syntax highlighter is supported.
- I think also http://repl.it also was working on something similar.
  - I think they are happy with CodeMirror, which is a fine choice

- ## Observable editor in observable_201909
- https://talk.observablehq.com/t/meta-observable-editor-in-observable/2376
  - One thing that I would like to do is to create a view with a nice text editor (ideally the same as the one used in observable) where users of my notebook can write some code with another linter (e.g. python) 
- Observable’s editor is based on CodeMirror. There’s a nice and simple example of CodeMirror in this notebook
- [CodeMirror inside of Observable](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/codemirror-inside-of-observable)
  - We use CodeMirror to power a lot of the editing abilities of Observable, but we can also embed CodeMirror inside of a notebook to provide an in-notebook editing experience.

- ## [codemirror 6 _202102](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26039111)
- One of the things I was hoping to see in this release was first-class LSP (language server protocol) support.
  - Sorbet (Ruby type checker) implements the LSP protocol and can be compiled to WASM
  - I'm especially excited to see mobile support as a headline feature, because that's completely lacking in Monaco. 
  - Maybe LSP support can be a future improvement.
- There's still no way to use create-react-app with monaco out of the box with offline support (@monaco-editor/react includes calls to a CDN instead of using the bundled JS).

- ## codemirror6: Decide how to distribute/manage CSS _201812
- https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next/issues/40
- Connecting modules to the CSS they rely on doesn't seem to be a solved problem in the JS ecosystem yet. Our plugins will often need a few lines of CSS to work. Requiring people to manually add `<link>` tags for each of those (which come from NPM and are probably not even in their web root by default) is a poor user experience.
  - I'm also not partial to schemes that inject the CSS into the page at run-time. When users are optimizing their page, they'd prefer to have control over how and when CSS is loaded, and not have that done at unpredictable moments by a script.
  - Who knows any existing approaches that we could take inspiration from?
- making it easy to write themes that integrate with the various plugins would be an advantage. 
  - This is one reason current codemirror.css defines all kinds of non-core styles—themes will want to include all of those as well.
- FWIW I took a stab a creating an Ubuntu theme package for CodeMirror 6. It was fun! 🆚️ The biggest difference from CM5 is having to deal with native selections, which can be styled with `::selection` .
  - The main suggestion I have after doing this is to more clearly separate the "core" CSS (required for correct layout) vs. "theme" CSS (that sets colors).
  - Regarding distribution, my gut feeling is that well organized plain old CSS would be best.
- Being a packaged component, we have somewhat different requirements than what most CSS-in-JS/CSS modules libraries are written for.
  - I was somewhat attracted to the idea of making all styles inline at first, since it nicely avoids the problem of having to create `<style>` tags and CSS rules at all, but that will often create really ugly DOM, and (more importantly) makes it impossible to support things like pseudo-classes and media queries, so I think we don't want that.
  - The alternative is to provide a way for scripts to generate class names from descriptions, and directly use those class names in the DOM. That doesn't work very well for highly dynamic CSS, but I guess the bulk of our CSS will fit the pattern just fine, and we can fall back to the `style` attribute for the rest.
- I was also working with styled-components for the past few days (I'm making a file tree component with react-virtualized).
  - I dropped CSSinJS at least for this case where performance IS the core component of the thing.
- Functional CSS makes the DOM directly reference the style. This works fine if you're in full control of the website, but a reusable component that wants to allow outside styling can't do that.
- style-module is much like a classical CSS module library, but works with sets of classes, rather than individual classes.
  - https://github.com/marijnh/style-mod
  - The idea behind that is that a plugin would define its styling as a style module containing classes for all the styleable elements it creates, and export that module. 
  - Client code can then extend this module and pass it back to the plugin as part of a configuration. 
  - If all plugins make sure they do this, and use the configured style module (with their own base module as a fallback) when styling, that should help with the overriding problem (without relying on side effects or global scopes).
  - The editor view itself would use a similar mechanism to allow the editor to be themed.

- ## We are rewriting CodeMirror _201808
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17858672
- Now I use Monaco aka Visual Studio Code. 
  - What would CodeMirror offer ? 
  - With Monaco I get all the lastest feature of VSCode . Current versions of Monaco include Intellisense etc.
  - I'm honestly curious both what CodeMirror will offer and why even try to compete. 
- CodeMirror aims to be slimmer, and less of a cut-off piece of vs code. I also think our API is more well designed and expressive. And, as Adrian mentioned below, though he got downvoted, CodeMirror works on phones
  - The fact that it works on mobile is the biggest advantage imho. We use it for that reason.
- monaco doesn't even try to work on mobile browsers.

- ## 🎯🤔 [CodeMirror 6.0 Stable Release | Hacker News _202206](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31666186)
- 🆚️ Why wasn't ProseMirror a fit for Obsidian? Seems like that would be better for structured documents.
  - For a good portion of its users, an important feature of Obsidian is the use of flat Markdown files.
  - I'm inquiring about actual implementation not Markdown. Markdown -> AST -> CodeMirror vs Markdown -> AST -> ProseMirror.
- Obsidian uses CM6 on all platforms.
  - A CM5 based editor is still available as "Legacy Editor" in the settings on desktop, to support older plugins.
  - Mobile was always using a CM6 editor, while desktop only got CM6 some time after that. Which is probably the source of the confusion.

- We're currently integrating CodeMirror 6 into Overleaf, and you can try it out by joining our beta program (which will give the option to select the beta source editor, which is the one built using CM6). 

- CodeMirror is also much more usable on touch devices than Monaco (VS Code’s editor component).
