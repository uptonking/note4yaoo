- ## How do I perform track changes in the quill editor just like Google docs?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58887843
- We tried to implement track changes/suggestions with QuillJS and came relatively far. But in the end it did not really work, since OT (Operational Transform, the format for syncing the changes) does not support hierarchical structures. The Team from CKEditor changed the OT to support this. But unfortunately it seems to be a lot of work 
- Prosemirror has also a relative positioning format, but it's not OT, they call it a step. 
  - For Prosemirror there are already some solutions for the track changes/suggestions problem. 
  - see wax-prosemirror, nib
