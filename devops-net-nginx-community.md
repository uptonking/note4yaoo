- ## 🆚️ What's the difference between load balancers, reverse proxies, and API Gateways?
- https://x.com/Franc0Fernand0/status/1905922643837984991
- 1. Load Balancers  
Their main job is sending client requests to several servers. The goal is to spread the load evenly so there are no bottlenecks and the system works smoothly.  

1. Reverse Proxies  
- They act as an intermediary for client requests, fetching data and communicating with servers on their behalf. They effectively hide the identity of the servers and provide them with increased security.  
- The main benefit of a reverse proxy is that it adds another level of control and abstraction to make sure that network traffic between clients and servers flows smoothly. 
- Reverse proxies reduce the risk of attacks and external threats and can provide additional benefits.   
- For example, they can cache content to reduce server load and compress data to improve transmission speed. 
- They also often handle SSL/TLS termination, which means they manage encrypted connections, offloading this task from the web servers.

1. API Gateways 
- Their main job is to serve as a single access point for all API calls. They send requests to the right microservices and gather the results. 
- The main benefit of an API Gateway is that it makes the client interface for different servers easier to use. 
  - It can also enforce rules, add extra layers of protection, translate between web protocols, and collect data from many services. 
- Their ideal use case is as entry points to microservices systems.

- Nginx, which is a Reverse Proxy can have several "upstreams" and spread the load between them

- ## [Traefik vs NGINX Proxy manager(NPM) : r/selfhosted _202501](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1hucr6c/traefik_vs_nginx_proxy_manager/)
- I discovered caddy and it was immediately obvious that I want that simplicity instead of 3 abstraction layers and complicated dynamic setup and labels. Caddy is just the winner for me, the perfect balance between feeling in control and ease of setup.

- Traefik all the way, even though I also use Nginx and HAproxy. I would never see the need to use NPM though, since Nginx is very easy to configure.

- I like NPM, because I can set up access to devices on multiple networks/VLANs, as well as open streams across VLANS for single port access. I have some services on my LAN, that need be there to "see" everything, and it is firewalled that only the NPM instance can access those

- I moved from NPM to Traefik. Took me a while to get my head around the fact that with docker integration, the proxy config is done not in Traefik but within the container itself. The yml config for stuff that's not running in containers is less straight forward. If NPM works for you, stick with it, I don't think function wise, none is superior than the other. They are both proxies, in the end.

- I used NPM for most of last year. It is a slick GUI and I liked adjacent containers like goaccess-for-nginxproxymanager for log monitoring 
  - Caddy already has http/3 which NPM still lacks--if that matters to you. I did recently switch to Caddy full time after I found out goaccess-for-NPM now supports caddy logs
  - Traefik seemed to offer a lot more features, none of which I want beyond a simple reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt, but also a lot more complicated setup, so I've never tried.

- ## [Traefik vs Ngnix Proxy Manager : r/selfhosted _202104](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/mhv0mx/traefik_vs_ngnix_proxy_manager/)
- I liked Ngnix Proxy Manager over Traefik since it has a GUI and i add and remove domains enough to find that valuable.

- ## [Traefic vs. Nginx : r/kubernetes _202109](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/pgj5c1/traefic_vs_nginx/)
- I like nginx a lot and have been using it up until I started using K8s. Nginx is very capable, but it fits a bit awkwardly into k8s because it comes from a time when text configuration was adequate, the new normal is API driven config, at least ingresses. For k8s I expect hot reload without any downtime and as far as I can tell Nginx does not provide that. I would opt for a k8s native ingress and Traefik looks good.
  - NGINX does "hot reload". Is it somewhat expensive by spawning new threads to replace old ones? Also yes. If you have medium to low traffic volumes, you probably won't notice it though. We run ingress-nginx in our production environments that reload dozens to hundreds of times per day, this has never been an issue for us.

- Contour is fully opensource without the licensing issues of Traefik. Also it's already supporting Gateway API [1] which will replace Ingresses.

- Nginx works quite well. I needed to proxy not just http but arbitrary tcp ports. Pulled my hair out reading traefik docs. Traefic update also broke http for me and that was it for me. Running nginx in production and works very well.

- ## 🆚 [Traefik vs NGINX: Compare Features and Benefits](https://traefik.io/compare/traefik-vs-nginx)
- Traefik Hub is a cloud-native API gateway and management platform that is built for modern multi-cloud, hybrid, and legacy migration scenarios. 
  - Unlike NGINX, Traefik Hub enables advanced API management, streamlines Day-2 operations, and provides robust observability in a single, extensible solution.

- ## 之前在服务器上用 docker 跑服务，需要折腾一下 Nginx 转发到 80 端口再套 Cloudflare 的解析。
- https://x.com/Stv_Lynn/status/1856325914076033419
  - 现在发现根本用不着这么烦，直接用 Cloudflare Tunnel 把端口转发出来就行了，甚至还能保护源站不被 censys 扫到。
  - 延迟会有一点差异。免费，能接受

- 在本机调试也是这样用，非常方便。

- 再来个tailscale，可以一个端口都不开

- 自用服务用tunnel 不错，但是没日志输出，跟nginx不一样

- 多一层还是有好处的，一个宽字符*dns记录多个子域名转到nginx上然自动proxy到多个容器上，如果tunnel负载加上nginx负载

- 然而用这个还是需要有域名，若是要用国内的云服务商，通过域名访问就要ICP备案

- ## [K8s体系下，ingress代表的云原生网关和传统的Nginx有哪些不同？会是未来的流量入口么？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/491886832)
- 在Kubernetes（K8s）体系下，Ingress（入口）是一种API对象，用于配置和管理应用程序服务的外部访问。
  - k8s中的ingress是一个标准规范，是定义外部流量进入集群内部的规则描述，
- ingress-nginx是一个具体的K8s ingress控制器提供者之一，通俗说就是一个k8s ingress的具体实现。同时也存在其他很多的实现，例如istio、kong等。

  - I checked nginx's prefix with nginx -V and see it is /opt/homebrew/Cellar/nginx/1.25.3 but why does the location search always start from /opt/homebrew/Cellar/nginx/1.25.3/html.

- The `html` part comes from nginx's default config

- ## 你目前在用哪种方式翻墙呢？ 🆚️
- https://x.com/__Inty__/status/1905650995750649966
- 这图挺误导人的，而且已经有些过时了
- v2RAY 很流行，软件多，节点多，提供商作坊多，trojan，提供的作坊比较少。支持的软件比较少
- 最安全的是 ssh 隧道，不过一般人搞不来。

- ## 一款内网穿透工具 Frp 的跨平台桌面客户端：Frpc-Desktop。
- https://x.com/GitHub_Daily/status/1893616798718685446
  - 开箱即用，提供简洁可视化配置界面，支持所有 Frp 版本，轻松实现内网穿透。
  - 还支持开机启动、快速分享 frps、所有配置的导入导出、批量端口等功能。
  - 兼容 Windows、macOS 和 Linux 系统安装使用。

- ## 内网穿透方案之tailscale+cloudflare tunnel
- https://x.com/Stv_Lynn/status/1878316656998649969
  - 很多homelab玩家拿到机器遇到的第一个问题就是怎么把服务部署到公网。
  - 有的人会选择frp，但考虑到国内服务器带宽和价格的情况下frp效果实在太差。
  - 也有人使用tailscale这种p2p方案，但这种并没有把服务暴露到公网。这里分享一个我的解决方案。
  - 首先你需要在本地机器和一台海外vps上都部署tailscale并且完成登录。关于vps的选择，推荐使用新加坡的vps（可以做到一机多用，能够正常代理ChatGPT，大多直连效果也不错），不推荐使用国内的vps，因为后面还要连接cloudflare。

- ## 有人用过 tailscale 的开源实现 headscale 吗？感觉也不错…想折腾一下。 
- https://x.com/tualatrix/status/1879877738733130087
- 都用，这类工具的核心是要打洞成功率。我一直都是  tailscale 和 zerotier 一起用，在我场景下，zerotier 的成功率明显高于 tailscale

- 没啥区别，到最后只要能打洞就行。headscale好就好在可以自建derp和无限机器。无限机器我们用不到，tailscale的就够用能直接打洞就不用自建，所以不如都有IPV6好

- 不好用，我就是用过那个之后才换到 tailscale 的。 另外， zeronet 也没有 tailscale 好用

- headscale只是tailscale的后端而已，用它可以不依赖tailscale的官方后台自由度高一点，客户端仍然还是用tailscale

- 个人感觉 headscale 完全没有必要，直接用 tailscale + 自建 derp 就行。

- 用过了，因为自建所以稳定性比不上官方，功能缺失挺多不好用，不如官方服务。

- ## 🆚️ Proxy Vs reverse proxy
- https://x.com/bytebytego/status/1885934707944345892
  - 正向代理侧重客户端限制，反向代理侧重服务端
- A forward proxy is a server that sits between user devices and the internet. A forward proxy is commonly used for: 
  - Protect clients
  - Block access to certain content
  - Avoid browsing restrictions
- A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from the client, forwards the request to web servers, and returns the results to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request. A reverse proxy is good for:
  - Protect servers
  - Load balancing
  - Cache static contents
  - Encrypt and decrypt SSL communications
