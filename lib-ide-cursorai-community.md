- ## Introducing AI Codex: the self-improving system for @cursor_ai .
- https://x.com/zbeyens/status/1832079140083687671
  - codex.md: Error and learning repository.
  - learn.md: Auto-save new insights.
  - split-codex.md: Smart categorization.
  - Free. Open Source. Ready-to-use template.
  - All my AI prompts are now at https://github.com/udecode/dotai, feel free to use and contribute!

- Codex idea is cool, I think all Ai could use that.
  - Yes that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt call it Cursor Codex.

- I had a similar idea with `knowledge.md` files: 
  - I like how you've refined the learning into clear algorithms.
  - [Manicode YC application](https://manifoldmarkets.notion.site/Manicode-YC-application-d748f8e890f24a3ba4b5308821a34351)

- Does this really work or is it just a waste of tokens?

- what's your workflow after using split-codex? Do you alter learn.md to account for there being multiple codex files?
  - You can add all the codex files in the composer Project, or tag the codex folder

- ## Introducing Dotai: a template to supercharge all @cursor_ai projects.
- https://x.com/zbeyens/status/1832345581617926231
  - codex: Error and learning repository
  - session: Project memory management
  - blueprints: Tech stack setup guides
  - plugins: Tool integrations like http://v0.dev

- Have you seen: https://cursor.directory
  - Pretty cool, but I think these prompts hardly fit real-world projects. I‚Äôll think about a solution.
- Yeah, it‚Äôs not complete. But it‚Äôs nice to system prompt your tech stack and coding style.

- Oh nice, so you have a running context file for a project as you use cursor and it answers questions and edits code, and you have a second file that tells the first file how to update itself as you code. Am I getting the gist of this approach correct?

- ## üí∞üÜöÔ∏è [Cursor Has Raised $60M | Hacker News _202408](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41325543)

- > Why Not an Extension?
  - As a standalone application, Cursor has more control over the UI of the editor, enabling greater AI integration. Some of our features, like Cursor Tab and CMD-K, are not possible as plugins to existing coding environments.

- ü™ß For reference, here is a list of the current main code assistants:
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Cursor.sh
  - Cody
  - Codeium
  - Amazon Q (formerly CodeWhisperer)
  - Pieces (This team is from Cincinnati, deserving a special mention from a fellow Cincinnatian)
  - Tabnine
  - Supermaven
  - Zencoder (waitlist)
  - Replit's Ghostwriter (not sure if it can be used outside of Replit)
- There are also tools that provide a UI for LLM models. While there are many, here are the main ones:
  - Continue.dev
  - Tabby
  - Aider
  - Double.bot
- Additionally, there is "Project IDX" from Google, though I am unsure how to classify it.

- ü§î I've been using Cursor for many months now. The biggest feature it had that I wanted when I first used it was searching your own repository. It indexes all of your code in a vector DB so that it can then use RAG to make suggestions against your own codebase. That was the "killer feature" for me - I don't get a ton of value from inline code completions, but I get LOTS of value if I can ask "Is there a utility function in this repo that does XYZ?" when working in a large codebase with lots of developers.

- Not that many people use Copilot Chat, anecdotally. We've focused on codebase chat when building Cody (https://cody.dev), since we can use a lot of the code search stuff we've built before. It's hard to build, esp. cross-repo where you can't just rely on what's accessible to your editor. 
  - Ollama models show up in the chat model dropdown in Cody, if Ollama is running on your machine.
  - Cody can use Ollama for both chat and autocomplete

- I know that Copilot can see open tabs as context.

- I‚Äôm sure this is great for some people. (Really, I‚Äôm sure it is.)
  - But whenever I‚Äôve tried Copilot I can‚Äôt stand it for more than a minute. Because sometimes it‚Äôs magical. And when it is, it is!
  - But then way more often it‚Äôs like having someone looking over my shoulder, telling me what they think I want to do, disrupting my thoughts.

- Genuine question: how do the economics work to raise $60M, for a product that costs at most $40/month?
  - Assuming $60M for 20%, that's a $300M valuation ($60M/20%).  ‰º∞ÂÄºÂ§ßÁ∫¶ÊòØ‰∫îÂÄçËûçËµÑ
  - Assuming a 10x multiple on revenue, that requires $30M in ARR ($300M/10). ‰º∞ÂÄºÂ§ßÁ∫¶ÊòØÂçÅÂÄçARR
  - Cursor only needs 83k paying users to hit that ARR.
  - Github has over 100M users. Copilot has 1M users.
  - It's a new, growing market.
- My napkin math is your valuation is usually 5 x raise amount and 10x annual revenue.
  - So valuation is 5*60m = 300m And expected annual revenue is 30m.
  - At 40/month they are expecting roughly 1M monthly actives. So I am guessing their pitch is with the vc money they will get to this number and beyond before the next funding round.
  - Reality is more like the founders got to cash "something" for their troubles and ability to sell the dream to others. Who knows may be they will hit it out of the park before the next round.
- interesting...and if you have this type of revenue who do you approach
  - If you have this kind of revenue, you don't approach anyone, they approach you.
- So the funding is usually for a "future" revenue. Ie to hit this goal. Imo if they had this revenue they'd be aiming for 10x that with a much higher valuation. VC funding is all about a growth story. If you can keep selling vision you never have to worry about revenues or hitting them. There's even a name for such schemes!
- what happens to the founders if they dont hit it
  - They either run out funding (so be forced to do layoffs, liquidations etc) or they have to find someone who can bail them out at unfavorable terms (read dilutions) or be really really good at story telling

- Considering Zed introduced AI and it's so much faster than Cursor or VSCode, I think the competition will be much harder than they sold to the investors.
  - Zed's approach of building the context manually with files and text and then asking for stuff is way more direct and less "magic". It works consistently.

- i think cursor is the only player that forked vscode. i've been using cursor for a week and i really like it. it's able to auto complete/correct code in multiple places at the same time. other copilot extensions in vscode were not able to do this. but i assume microsoft will quickly add this feature in vscode and others will catch up soon. 

- [Cursor: We Raised $60M | Hacker News _202408](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41321996)
  - It's its own editor (albeit[ËôΩÁÑ∂ÔºõÂ∞ΩÁÆ°] forked from VS Code), it's not a VS Code extension.
  - This is the problem with this industry and this appears to be a acquisition vehicle rather than an actual sustainable business.
  - They probably know they don't have a moat(Â£ïÊ≤üÔºõÊä§ÂüéÊ≤≥), but once again; all for the better to take advantage of the AI bubble and exit out quickly once it collapses.

- ## Free and open source Alternative to Cursor's composer feature directly in Replit
- https://x.com/itsPaulAi/status/1828472273260683627
  - Cursor's composer is getting a lot of buzz because it lets anyone create apps using just English.
- There is also ClaudeEngineer

- Can we do SQL?  
  - Yes you can.aider .chat/docs/languages.html

- Set up the free open-source alternative to Cursor Composer in less than 3 minutes in Replit _202408
- https://x.com/itsPaulAi/status/1828834199597633724
  - Steps to use Aider chat:
  - Create a new Python Repl
  - Generate your Anthropic API key
  - Paste it into the ‚ÄúIntegrations‚Äù section
  - Install and run the aider-chat package
  - I also recommend that you take a look at Aider's extensive documentation if you need to.

- so this only works for python repls?
  - Yes but you can make it write any language and run with Flask.

- https://x.com/arpagon/status/1827315413950046225
  - And now, http://trypear.ai by @not_nang and @CodeFryingPan is trying to achieve parity of functionality with Cursor, but in a more transparent and, of course, open-source way.
- Yes, Cursor is based on Continue.
