# [styling](https://codemirror.net/6/examples/styling/)

- CodeMirror uses a CSS-in-JS system to be able to include its styles directly in the script files. 
  - This means you don't have to include a library CSS file in your page for the editor to work‚Äîboth the editor view's own styling and any styling defined for dependencies are automatically pulled in through the JavaScript module system.
- Themes are simply extensions that tell the editor to mount an additional style module and add the (generated) class name that enables those styles to its outer DOM element.
# [(Re-) Implementing A Syntax-Highlighting Editor in JavaScript_201111](https://codemirror.net/5/doc/internals.html)
- CodeMirror 1 was heavily reliant on designMode or contentEditable (depending on the browser)
  - Neither of these are well specified (HTML5 tries to specify their basics), and, more importantly, they tend to be one of the more obscure and buggy areas of browser functionality
- What CodeMirror 2 does is try to sidestep most of the hairy hacks 
  - I absolutely did not want to be completely reliant on key events to generate my input.
  - Some people (most awesomely Mihai Bazon with Ymacs) have been able to build more or less functioning editors by directly reading key events, but it takes a lot of work (the kind of never-ending, fragile work I described earlier), and will never be able to properly support things like multi-keystoke international character input.
  - üëâüèª So what I do is focus a hidden textarea, and let the browser believe that the user is typing into that. What we show to the user is a DOM structure we built to represent his document. If this is updated quickly enough, and shows some kind of believable cursor, it feels like a real text-input control.
  - Another big win is that this DOM representation does not have to span the whole document. 
- ACE uses its hidden textarea only as a text input shim, and does all cursor movement and things like text deletion itself by directly handling key events. 
- CodeMirror's way is to let the browser do its thing as much as possible, and not, for example, define its own set of key bindings. 
  - One way to do this would have been to have the whole document inside the hidden textarea, and after each key event update the display DOM to reflect what's in that textarea.
- That'd be simple, but it is not realistic. For even medium-sized document the editor would be constantly munging huge strings, and get terribly slow. 
  - üëâüèª What CodeMirror 2 does is put the current selection, along with an extra line on the top and on the bottom, into the textarea.
- 201111 Recently, I've made some changes to the codebase that cause some of the text above to no longer be current. I've left the text intact, but added markers at the passages that are now inaccurate. 

- The original implementation of CodeMirror 2 represented the document as a flat array of line objects.
  - However, I recently added line wrapping and code folding (line collapsing, basically). Once lines start taking up a non-constant amount of vertical space, looking up a line by vertical position (which is needed when someone clicks the document, and to determine the visible part of the document during scrolling) can only be done with a linear scan through the whole array, summing up line heights as you go. Seeing how I've been going out of my way to make big documents fast, this is not acceptable.
- The new representation is based on a B-tree. The leaves of the tree contain arrays of line objects, with a fixed minimum and maximum size, and the non-leaf nodes simply hold arrays of child nodes. 
  - Each node stores both the amount of lines that live below them and the vertical space taken up by these lines. 
  - This allows the tree to be indexed both by line number and by vertical position, and all access has logarithmic complexity in relation to the document size.
- I chose B-trees, not regular binary trees, mostly because they allow for very fast bulk insertions and deletions. 

- The hidden textarea now only holds the current selection, with no extra characters around it. This has a nice advantage: polling for input becomes much, much faster
  - The reason that cheap polling is important is that many browsers do not fire useful events on IME (input method engine) input, which is the thing where people inputting a language like Japanese or Chinese use multiple keystrokes to create a character or sequence of characters. 
  - Most modern browsers fire input when the composing is finished, but many don't fire anything when the character is updated during composition. 
  - So we poll, whenever the editor is focused, to provide immediate updates of the display.
# roadmap

## [CodeMirror 6 Status Update_201908](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/codemirror-6-progress.html)

- It has been almost a year since we officially announced the CodeMirror 6 project, which aims to rewrite CodeMirror (a code editor for in the browser) to align its design with the technological realities and fashions of the late 2010s.
- we integrate a new approach to code parsing.
- we finished a doc comment extractor for TypeScript
- I'm definitely suffering from second system syndrome, where after eight years with the old system, I am acutely aware of its limitations and want to fix them all this time around. 
  - That sometimes leads me into overly-ambitious design rabbit holes, and then it takes me a week or two to dig myself out again.
- Composition Support
  - Handling composition/IME (input method editor) in the browser is its own special kind of hell.
- Behaviors as Extension Primitive
  - A design where a generic core provides a platform for all kinds of features to be implemented in plugins has to, in a way, provide an extendable extension mechanism
  - I think we landed on a nice architecture. 
- CSS Modules
  - Since the browser platform's CSS support is still more or less completely unhelpful when it comes to modularized system, we've decided to use a CSS-in-JS approach where extensions can define their own styles from within JavaScript code and make sure they are included in the document or shadow DOM where the editor is placed.
- View Fields and Updates
  - I've added a new abstraction, view fields, for pieces of state that live in the view and affect things like decorations (styling and widgets in the content) and the attributes of the editor's wrapper DOM nodes.
- Block Widgets
  - Block widgets are a way to insert a block element into the document, either on a line boundary, in the middle of a line, or covering some content.
- Generic Gutters
- Doc Generation
- Lezer
  - tree-sitter, which is a practical implementation of an incremental LR parser, giving you a real syntax tree for your code and updating it cheaply when you make changes. It is used in the Atom editor.
  - I set out to clone tree-sitter in JavaScript. I didn't exactly clone it, but rather built a different system inspired by it. 
  - That system is Lezer, an incremental parser generator and runtime system for JavaScript.

- ## Meta: Observable editor in observable
- https://talk.observablehq.com/t/meta-observable-editor-in-observable/2376
  - One thing that I would like to do is to create a view with a nice text editor (ideally the same as the one used in observable) where users of my notebook can write some code with another linter (e.g. python) 
- Observable‚Äôs editor is based on CodeMirror. There‚Äôs a nice and simple example of CodeMirror in this notebook
- [CodeMirror inside of Observable](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/codemirror-inside-of-observable)
  - We use CodeMirror to power a lot of the editing abilities of Observable, but we can also embed CodeMirror inside of a notebook to provide an in-notebook editing experience.

- ## codemirror 6 
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26039111
- One of the things I was hoping to see in this release was first-class LSP (language server protocol) support.
  - Sorbet (Ruby type checker) implements the LSP protocol and can be compiled to WASM
  - I'm especially excited to see mobile support as a headline feature, because that's completely lacking in Monaco. 
  - Maybe LSP support can be a future improvement.
- There's still no way to use create-react-app with monaco out of the box with offline support (@monaco-editor/react includes calls to a CDN instead of using the bundled JS).

- ## codemirror6: Decide how to distribute/manage CSS_201812
- https://github.com/codemirror/codemirror.next/issues/40
- Connecting modules to the CSS they rely on doesn't seem to be a solved problem in the JS ecosystem yet. Our plugins will often need a few lines of CSS to work. Requiring people to manually add `<link>` tags for each of those (which come from NPM and are probably not even in their web root by default) is a poor user experience.
  - I'm also not partial to schemes that inject the CSS into the page at run-time. When users are optimizing their page, they'd prefer to have control over how and when CSS is loaded, and not have that done at unpredictable moments by a script.
  - Who knows any existing approaches that we could take inspiration from?
- making it easy to write themes that integrate with the various plugins would be an advantage. 
  - This is one reason current codemirror.css defines all kinds of non-core styles‚Äîthemes will want to include all of those as well.
- FWIW I took a stab a creating an Ubuntu theme package for CodeMirror 6. It was fun! The biggest difference from CM5 is having to deal with native selections, which can be styled with ::selection.
  - The main suggestion I have after doing this is to more clearly separate the "core" CSS (required for correct layout) vs. "theme" CSS (that sets colors).
  - Regarding distribution, my gut feeling is that well organized plain old CSS would be best.
- Being a packaged component, we have somewhat different requirements than what most CSS-in-JS/CSS modules libraries are written for.
  - I was somewhat attracted to the idea of making all styles inline at first, since it nicely avoids the problem of having to create `<style>` tags and CSS rules at all, but that will often create really ugly DOM, and (more importantly) makes it impossible to support things like pseudo-classes and media queries, so I think we don't want that.
  - The alternative is to provide a way for scripts to generate class names from descriptions, and directly use those class names in the DOM. That doesn't work very well for highly dynamic CSS, but I guess the bulk of our CSS will fit the pattern just fine, and we can fall back to the `style` attribute for the rest.
- I was also working with styled-components for the past few days (I'm making a file tree component with react-virtualized).
  - I dropped CSSinJS at least for this case where performance IS the core component of the thing.
- Functional CSS makes the DOM directly reference the style. This works fine if you're in full control of the website, but a reusable component that wants to allow outside styling can't do that.
- style-module is much like a classical CSS module library, but works with sets of classes, rather than individual classes.
  - https://github.com/marijnh/style-mod
  - The idea behind that is that a plugin would define its styling as a style module containing classes for all the styleable elements it creates, and export that module. 
  - Client code can then extend this module and pass it back to the plugin as part of a configuration. 
  - If all plugins make sure they do this, and use the configured style module (with their own base module as a fallback) when styling, that should help with the overriding problem (without relying on side effects or global scopes).
  - The editor view itself would use a similar mechanism to allow the editor to be themed.

- ## We are rewriting CodeMirror_201808
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17858672
- Now I use Monaco aka Visual Studio Code. 
  - What would CodeMirror offer ? 
  - With Monaco I get all the lastest feature of VSCode . Current versions of Monaco include Intellisense etc.
  - I'm honestly curious both what CodeMirror will offer and why even try to compete. 
- CodeMirror aims to be slimmer, and less of a cut-off piece of vs code. I also think our API is more well designed and expressive. And, as Adrian mentioned below, though he got downvoted, CodeMirror works on phones
  - The fact that it works on mobile is the biggest advantage imho. We use it for that reason.
- monaco doesn't even try to work on mobile browsers.
