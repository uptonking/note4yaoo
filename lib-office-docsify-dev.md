# lib-office-docsify-dev

## guide

- https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify
  - 依赖marked、prismjs
  - A magical documentation site generator.
  - No statically built html files, Support SSR, Support embedded files
    - there is literally no build step
    -  unlike many static generators no HTML static site is created... update the Markdown and the site immediately shows those changes.
  - Useful plugin API, Smart full-text search plugin
  - Docsify is way way easier, probably because all the “build” stuff is happening via the javascript in realtime.
