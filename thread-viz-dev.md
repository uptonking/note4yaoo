# pieces

- ## 


- ## If PDFs are where data goes to die, where does data go to *live*?
- https://twitter.com/chris_whong/status/1372990040113053702
- I hate myself for saying this, but... Excel.
- Anywhere with an open data license, a decent API, and an explanation of fields and collection methods. 
  - Any format people can read and use easily. http://data.ny.gov, http://humdata.org, http://datacatalog.worldbank.org etc: data needs eyeballs and motives to live
- AirTable and APIs
- https://github.com/simonw/datasette
  - https://global-power-plants.datasettes.com/global-power-plants/global-power-plants
  - a tool for exploring and publishing data. 
  - It helps people take data of any shape or size and publish that as an interactive, explorable website and accompanying API.

- ## Observable Collaboration is a huge leap forward for thinking with data, together. And it‚Äôs a new architecture for Observable, taking us into the future.

  - Our new front-end has a Redux-inspired state system, which with Next.js‚Äô server-side props and TypeScript have dramatically improved our dev velocity.
  - We also have a new multiplayer editor and client-server architecture  building on CodeMirror 6
  - The challenges here are deep. But in remote-first times, it brings me so much joy to be ‚Äúin the notebook‚Äù with others.
- I've set up an example for collaborative editing in CodeMirror 6. With a very cute interactive demo

- ## here's a UX question I'm thinking over: Does a log scale work better than a linear one for profiling tools (given that most commits are usually small)
- https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1368219961383063552
  - With a log scale would people be surprised to find out that the 18ms commit was only 18ms compared to the much taller (yellow) 224ms commit? With a linear scale, would they be frustrated that an 18ms commit was impossible to find without individually stepping through each commit?
  - Is there a third approach I haven't considered? (I bet there's lots of research here that I'm unaware of.)
- I‚Äôd say linear is more true to the data
  - it will however lead to missing some less severe peaks. Difficult tradeoff. 
  - I think log will work but you‚Äôd have to make it clear to prevent people from comparing height in absolute terms. 
  - Other option is hiding the extremes (switchable)
- the dots represent the number of articles per interval. we wanted to keep the scale the same across charts & keep it meaningful (üîµ = 1 article). whenever there are more than 15, it adds a hat to keep it from overwhelming the chart
- Log scale works when the differences between individual varies in degrees of magnitude such. Example. 2, 20, 200, 2000, 20000. Differ in an exponential fashion. 10^1, 10^2, 10^3
- The graph is too small to make a meaningful comparison anyways so definitely go with log here (I‚Äôm guessing this is an overview and you can drill down further). Alternatively you could try (not saying it‚Äôs a good idea) to use log for the bar height and linear for the bar color
