- ## I'm excited to share a preview of natto.dev, a canvas for writing and manipulating JavaScript.
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1370402539720503298
  - It's kinda like a JS playground, script runner, API client, JSON viewer, datavis tool, .. not sure exactly but it feels like something!
- nice! dragging a column out of a table is awesome. I also like the design of the wires, ambiently visible but light enough to not feel too "in the way"
  - I could imagine a non-programmer playing with this, and gradually picking up JS by messing w the code snippets
- each pane is an expression but you could fit arbitrary long content in a single expression.
  - it's kinda like a Swift playground but you choose where the logpoints are.
