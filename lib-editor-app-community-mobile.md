- ## This is a good post, and also feels like the exact state I found for #reactnative rich text editing when I added it to our app in late 2019

  - I went with the "custom webview-based editor" approach, and reached for using Trix from Basecamp
  - We have a very simple Trix setup. Trix.js is bundled natively in our app, with simple HTML files to render via webview
  - This webview-based editor method provides a great interface with the bells and whistles a browser-based WYSIWYG editor provides. 
  - We currently have a team revamping this project, and utilizing https://tiptap.dev this go-round in place of Trix
