    - Virtual syntax highlighting for virtual DOMs and non-HTML things
    - This package uses `highlight.js` for syntax highlighting and outputs objects (ASTs) instead of a string of HTML.
    - This package is useful when you want to perform syntax highlighting in a place where serialized HTML wouldn‚Äôt work or wouldn‚Äôt work well. 
    - You can use the similar `refractor` if you want to use `Prism` grammars instead. 
    - If you‚Äôre looking for a really good (but rather heavy) alternative, use `starry-night`.
