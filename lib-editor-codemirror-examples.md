- https://github.com/ekzhang/cm-collab /ts
  - A tiny collaborative Markdown editor based on CodeMirror, communicating with a minimal server and database.
  - Supports multiple real-time documents, with live cursors. Based on CodeMirror's **operational transformation** extension
  - The backend is stateless and even avoids WebSockets by relying on HTTP/2.
  - Unlike most toy examples, this application persists data and cleans up database memory. 
  - Documents are stored in Postgres, and real-time changes are resolved over Redis, with compaction.
