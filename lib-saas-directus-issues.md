- ## ðŸ”’ [Public User Registration ](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/3083)

- How to determine role with public registration?
  - email domain, default role no permissions, ...
  - create invite link endpoint (role associated with the endpoint), public page option

- [user signup not possible? ](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/10445)
  - 202112: There's currently no native "public registration" functionality through the regular login. You can already configure the SSO providers to create the user on first login.
  - use the `AUTH__ALLOW_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION` setting

- [how can I implement registering user functionality? _202202](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/12135)
  - Seeing that you'd like to use JWT based auth, and allow SSO logins etc etc, I would recommend simply using `directus_users` for these users as well, rather than trying to rebuild the auth system on a custom `users` table. That way, you get everything out of the box. 
  - You could create a new role for these app-users, that doesn't have access to the Directus app (meaning that they're still users in the API, but can't access the admin app)

- ## ðŸ›’ [Extension Marketplace](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/2820)
