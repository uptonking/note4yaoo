- ## [The ability to rename columns in table layout, especially for those that are properties of relations ](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/13277)

- ## üÜîÔ∏è [Ability to rename collections and fields ](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/2711)
- 202401: Realistically the only way to support this natively is to start relying on UUIDs for collections/fields instead of the database key. Trying to update the name in like 30 places every time you want to change the key feels very error prone

- 202401: For anyone here that is only concerned about what the Directus user sees and not names in the underlying database, you can use `field name translations` and `collection naming translations` to change the name throughout the Directus Studio. It doesn't change anything for the underlying database or the API, but it's better than nothing!

- ## üîí [Public User Registration ](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/3083)

- How to determine role with public registration?
  - email domain, default role no permissions, ...
  - create invite link endpoint (role associated with the endpoint), public page option

- [user signup not possible? ](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/10445)
  - 202112: There's currently no native "public registration" functionality through the regular login. You can already configure the SSO providers to create the user on first login.
  - use the `AUTH__ALLOW_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION` setting

- [how can I implement registering user functionality? _202202](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/12135)
  - Seeing that you'd like to use JWT based auth, and allow SSO logins etc etc, I would recommend simply using `directus_users` for these users as well, rather than trying to rebuild the auth system on a custom `users` table. That way, you get everything out of the box. 
  - You could create a new role for these app-users, that doesn't have access to the Directus app (meaning that they're still users in the API, but can't access the admin app)

- ## [How to custom field type? _202204](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/12674)
- You can create custom interfaces by extension

- ## üõí [Extension Marketplace](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/2820)
- 202305: This feature request has received over 15 votes from the community. This means we'll move this feature request to the Under Review state

- ## [Custom fields in `directus_fields` doesn't show up in App when editing/creating a field _202211](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/16432)
- Since we're able to create custom fields in system collections, it would be nice to have a place to set those values on all the collections.
