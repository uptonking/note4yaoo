- ## Render a virtual section instead of put in the dom_202110
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/render-a-virtual-section-instead-of-put-in-the-dom/4142
- Virtual rendering is not something this library supports, sorry.

- ## Optimize prosemirror-view with intersection observer api?_202103
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/optimize-prosemirror-view-with-intersection-observer-api/3580
  - I find that one hot spot is iterDeco(…) in prosemirror-view. 
  - In iterDeco() the code seems have to iterate over the whole list of contents to find matching ones. 
  - I was wondering is it possible to optimize this procedure with intersection observer api? so that we can limit the iteration range down to leaf nodes being shown in the viewport and selection.

- Viewport-based drawing is out of scope for ProseMirror. 
  - It’s just too much extra complexity and failure modes. (It might be possible to rig something up with an external plugin, but it’s not going to be easy.)
  - That being said, the expected bottleneck for huge documents is the DOM. iterDeco being the slow part isn’t expected. 

- ## Efficient Viewport rendering? (like CodeMirror)_201701
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/efficient-viewport-rendering-like-codemirror/577
- this is intentionally out of scope, because it was already hugely complicated to get right in a plain text editor like CodeMirror, and I don’t want to bloat and complicate this library with this functionality. I know this can be useful to have, but I’m not tackling it.
  - I have no idea how to cleanly do that. And that’s why I didn’t do it.

- ## Single step with too large data
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/single-step-with-too-large-data/3234
- This isn’t something the library will do for you. You could try to do something in dispatchTransaction that, if a large insertion has multiple nodes at its top level, splits it into smaller insertions, but that wouldn’t always work (say, when pasting a single huge list).

- ## Performance Issues with ProseMirror and Chrome
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/performance-issues-with-prosemirror-and-chrome/2498
- Chrome plugins (e.g. Grammarly or other spell checkers) impact performance because they run in the same browsing context as ProseMirror.
