- [Undo/Redo | CKEditor 5 Documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/undo-redo.html)
  - The undo feature lets you withdraw recent changes to your content as well as bring them back. 
  - You can also selectively revert past changes, not just the latest ones.
  - The selective undo is heavily used in real-time collaboration environments. In such a scenario, a specific user should only be able to revert their changes, while keeping the changes made by other users intact
