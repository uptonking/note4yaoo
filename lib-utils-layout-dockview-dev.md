- ## [Save group restrictions as a part of layout object ](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/493)
- Group constraints currently come with quite a few limitations including the fact they are not persisted. It would need some careful though into how this might work if it was added.

- ## [Unable to persist fullscreen / maximized mode ](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/494)

- ## [Implement default width and height for Dockview panels ](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/589)

- ## [Linking the states of nested dock instances ](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/532)
- When we dynamically add a panel inside a nested dockview, it cannot save to local storage.
  - I guess the problem is because when we create a nested dockview, it will create a new API instance. However when we save the state by calling toJson we just handled the parent/container API. But I'm not sure how to merge/combine these apis into one and save to localstorage.

- By creating another dock within the panel of an existing dock you are creating a new instance of the dock component. They are not linked internally in any way and do not know about each other.
  - Currently it is expected that the if the user creates a nested dock, they save that nested dock state seperately and use their application state (perhaps associate that nested layout with the `id` of the panel it's nested within) to link everything back together. 
  - Think of the nested dock JSON as just some application state you would associate with that panel within your application.

- ## ü§î [Mention how to manage shared state that isn't "params" _202403](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/543)
- I got something to work using React `Context` . I think this might be the simplest way to do it. Wrap the `<DockviewReact>` in a context that is specifically for that Dockview, and then any prop based data you want to pass down to panels can exist there.

- Correct, dockview doesn't provide a way for you to render React components directly as children because of a number of reasons - mostly because the panels can be deserialized from application state and this requires assigning react components to ids etc etc... described more in Registering and Adding.
  - The purpose of the params that you can provide to each panel are more for static purposes, something you may wish to persist with layout
  - Under the hood though each panel is added to React through React Portals so things like React Context and the React DOM Tree are well preserved.
  - If you have any good examples of sending through application state without using a full state mananger (redux, mobx etc) I would be more than happy to accept PRs - the more examples and docs the better in my opinion.

- ## [Possible to stop floating windows being dragged outside visible dockview area? ¬∑ mathuo/dockview ¬∑ Discussion #325](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/discussions/325)
- You can include both snap and priority when adding items to the Gridview through .addPanel(). Those flags don't exist on the Dockview since they don't make sense in that context. I will make sure I add all this to the gridview docs.

- ## [Possible to stop floating windows being dragged outside visible dockview area? ¬∑ mathuo/dockview ¬∑ Discussion #325](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/discussions/325)

- ## üí° [[BUG] dockview craches when changing from excalidraw ](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/317)
- When you switch tabs in dockview the panel that becomes hidden is removed from the dom but the React component remains active (so that if you was to return to that panel the component would be as left) however this only works if some assumptions are obeyed, one of which being that component doesn't try to access the window because whilst hidden it has been removed from the window and has no access to it.
- If you find that you do not want to destory the component and you want it to remain active even when not visible, it may be worth reading how dockview allows you to work with iframes too here since this would allow a particular component to remain attached to the dom even when not visible.
  - This approach is suitable when you are ok with the underlying React component being unmouted when the panel is hidden.

- and another link using a similar approach where the panel is absolutely positioned and hidden as required but never removed from the dom, based on the iframe examples found on dockview.dev
  - This approach keeps the panel attached to the dom at all times but will hide the element as and when required.

- ## [Need an easy to to know if a panel/group is floating ](https://github.com/mathuo/dockview/issues/583)
- Both the panel and group `api` object expose a `location` property as an object 
  - For example `api.location.type` for floating groups should be equal to `floating` . this may not be well documented

# docs
- Dockview was originally a React-only library which is why the React version maintains the name `dockview` after splitting the core logic into a separate package named `dockview-core`.

- dockview-theme-abyss: Based on Visual Studio Code abyss theme
  - The provided themes are controlled primarily through a long list of CSS variables which can be modified by the user either entirely for a new theme or partial for a modification to an existing theme.

- Each panel has an api which is used to control specific features on that individual panel. 
  - The panel also has access the group api and the container api.
- To open a panel requires a unique id and the name of the component to render.
  - To render a custom tab component you should specify the tabComponent.
- You can position a panel relative to an existing panel, group using direction. 
  - If you do not provide a reference panel or group then the panel will be positioned to the edge of the dock in the specified direction.

- You can update a panel through the Panel API.
  - Use this feature sparingly: Anything you assign to the params options of a panel will be saved when calling api.toJSON(). Only use this to store small amounts of static view data. Do not use this to store application state or dynamic panel state.

- You can move a panel through the Panel API and you can find out how to move a Group here. panel.api.moveTo({ group, position, index }); 

- Rendering type is an important consideration when creating your application and whether your panels should be destroyed when hidden.
- When a panel is selected, all other panels in that group are not visible. 
  - `onlyWhenVisible`: Remove the element from the DOM tree to make space for the new panel.
  - `always`: Keep the DOM tree alive but hide it in order to allow the select panels content to show.
- Both are valid use-cases therefore the dock allows you to choose your rendering mode, the default however is the first option since this is the most memory efficient solution.
- By default `DockviewReact` only adds to the DOM those panels that are visible, if a panel is not the active tab and not shown the contents of the hidden panel will be removed from the DOM.

- The panel instance is only ever destroyed when it is removed from the dock allowing you to still run code associated with the panel when it is not visible. 
  - The renderer only affects what happens to the DOM element.

- Each dock contains groups and each group contains panels. 
  - Logically a user may want to resize a panel but this really translates to resizing the group which contains that panel.
  - The panel resize methods are repeats of the same resize methods found on the group.
- Each Dockview contains of a number of groups and each group has a number of panels. 
  - Logically a user may want to resize a panel, but this translates to resizing the group which contains that panel.

- Dockview supports a wide variety of built-in Drag and Drop possibilities.
  - Merge one group with another group
  - Move both Tabs and Groups in relation to the container

- Dockview fire and intercepts Drag & Drop events extensively however it is indended that the user has ultimate control over all events.
  - External Dnd events can be intercepted through a number of utilities.

- Dockview has built-in support for floating groups. 
  - Each floating container can contain a single group with many panels and you can have as many floating containers as needed. 
  - You cannot dock multiple groups together in the same floating container.

- Locking a group will disable all drop events for this group ensuring no additional panels can be added to the group through drop events. 
  - You can still add groups to a locked panel programatically using the API though.

- Dockview has built-in support for opening groups in new Windows. 
  - Each popout window can contain a single group with many panels and you can have as many popout windows as needed. 
  - You cannot dock multiple groups together in the same window.
  - Popout groups cannot be maximized. Calling maximize function on groups in these states will have no effect.
  - Popout windows require your website to have a blank .html page that can be used, by default this is set to /popout.html but can be configured to match requirements.

- A panel will appear with a scrollbar if the the contents of your view has a fixed height. 
  - If you are using a relative height such as 100% you will need a child container with the appropriate overflow value to allow for scrollbars.

- iFrames required special attention because of a particular behaviour in how iFrames render:
  - Re-parenting an iFrame will reload the contents of the iFrame or the rephrase this, moving an iFrame within the DOM will cause a reload of its contents.
- To ensure iFrames work as expected you should render them in panels with `renderer: 'always'` to ensure they are never removed from the DOM, alternatively set the `defaultRenderer` to `always`.
