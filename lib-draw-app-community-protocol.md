  - Building atop @obsmd 's JSON Canvas, we will work to establish a robust file format to enable interoperability between infinite canvas tools.
  - Participants: @tldraw , @excalidraw , @statelyai , @KinopioClub , @dxos_org , and others
  - I was able to set up very simple two-way sync between TLDraw and Obsidian.
  - Live collaboration across tools is ultimately what we'd love to enable.

- Initially we'll focus on establishing minimal interop between a small set of canvases. Ultimately, we seek to drive rich interoperability across a wide variety of tools.

- Why a file format?
  - Files enable longevity. Databases get turned off. Files live forever.
  - Files enable easy migration between tools, fighting vendor lock-in.
  - Ultimately, we hope to enable collaboration in real-time using different canvas tools.
