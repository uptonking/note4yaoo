- ## Has anyone built something like a distributed (write-back) page cache that sits above S3? 
- https://twitter.com/criccomini/status/1721918972604682362
  - Idea would be to reduce read latency and API calls? Similar to WarpStream‚Äôs mmap.
- Arguably libSQL and LiteFS are just that. The only gotcha is that you can only access the page cache with SQL
  - What if I want multiple simultaneous readers and writers?
- Write-back is a bit scary no, or maybe I'm missing something? I think those systems should be write-through (or read-through, with cache expiry)
  - Yes, write-back requires its own replication and stuff. But you get batching. I think you want write-back if the API is a KV store. If the API is just S3 compatible, I think write-through is fine. Main advantage for write-back would be batching (which you want in KV stores).
- Ah yes, I get what you're saying now. For a sophisticated implementation you do need the WAL-memtable-type thingy you're describing, or it'll be very expensive. Or, if you're lucky... your clients do most of their updates in big batches
- I'd be super interested if such a thing exists. We want to move our materialized view stores to S3 at @responsive_apps , but the write latency is prohibitive(Ë¥µÂæóÁî®‰∏çËµ∑ÔºàÊàñ‰π∞‰∏çËµ∑ÔºâÁöÑ).
- Not sure it fits your need, but have a look at fsspec/s3fs. It has caching options that may help

- ## There are so many exciting local-first projects around SQLite 
- https://twitter.com/penberg/status/1719779549766934545
  - such as @ElectricSQL , CR-SQLite (by @tantaman ), SQLSync (by @carlsverre ), and @evoluhq , but I fear API fragmentation might be holding back adoption. 
  - As an application developer, which one do you pick and why?
- How do they handle authentication and authorization ? I can‚Äôt seem to find how access controls are done with local-first without a server being involved
  - If there isn‚Äôt a server involved it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwill send‚Äù and ‚Äúwill accept‚Äù type of model. A node will send a row to you if you pass its auth checks for the row. A node will accept a write from you if you pass it‚Äôs auth checks to write the row.

- RxDB used PouchDB under the hood for a while, but now there's a bunch of storage drivers to pick from. The problem for me seems to stem from trying to sync too much data at a time, and the sync chokes. I have a podcast app with thousands of episodes and 100+MB of data.
- Since RxDB v13 or so, the sync works in parallel in both directions for better performance. So maybe there should be a throttle when much data is synced.
