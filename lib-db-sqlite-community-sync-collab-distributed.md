- ## There are so many exciting local-first projects around SQLite 
- https://twitter.com/penberg/status/1719779549766934545
  - such as @ElectricSQL , CR-SQLite (by @tantaman ), SQLSync (by @carlsverre ), and @evoluhq , but I fear API fragmentation might be holding back adoption. 
  - As an application developer, which one do you pick and why?
- How do they handle authentication and authorization ? I can‚Äôt seem to find how access controls are done with local-first without a server being involved
  - If there isn‚Äôt a server involved it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwill send‚Äù and ‚Äúwill accept‚Äù type of model. A node will send a row to you if you pass its auth checks for the row. A node will accept a write from you if you pass it‚Äôs auth checks to write the row.

- RxDB used PouchDB under the hood for a while, but now there's a bunch of storage drivers to pick from. The problem for me seems to stem from trying to sync too much data at a time, and the sync chokes. I have a podcast app with thousands of episodes and 100+MB of data.
- Since RxDB v13 or so, the sync works in parallel in both directions for better performance. So maybe there should be a throttle when much data is synced.
