- ## Vibe coding culture will make many people understand that a website or app is not a business; a business has a website or app.
- https://x.com/Benn_X1/status/2025308341811970237
  - The most important department in any company is sales/marketing. You’ll need to go outside and touch grass after vibe coding the perfect product with AI.
  - You’ll need customers, and you’ll learn very hard lessons if you’re attempting to vibe code a B2B product.

- Building something is now the easy part. The hard part was always distribution and understanding why someone would pay for it. Vibe coding just removes the illusion that the code was ever the bottleneck.
  - The B2B point especially - you cant vibe code domain expertise or customer relationships

- Vibe coding just removed the "I can't build it" excuse. Now you're left with "I can't sell it" which was always the real problem. The people who win aren't the best coders or the best vibe coders. They're the ones who know their customer.

- A polished app isn’t a business, distribution, sales, and real customer demand are. Vibe coding can build the product; it can’t build the market.

- If you can’t sell the problem your code solves, you’ve just built a very high-tech hobby, not a business.

- https://x.com/ivanalog_com/status/2025583968167281010
  - 快，很少是商业的核心价值；
  - 正确，稳定，安全，高精度，可信赖地方式达成目的，往往才是重点。
  - 而Vibe这种形式，一开始就对后者不够重视。
  - 商业本身的价值，就在于可预测性和强可靠性，这是AI作品目前最缺乏的。
  - 当然，反过来说，AI本身只是一个工具，是否重视商业的某一个侧面，或者使用AI代替具体哪一个环节，还是由使用AI的人决定的。未来机会无限。
  - 说的极端一点就是，对于一家银行来说，除非有致命错误，不然，用rust代替cobol，用新架构代替一个运行稳定几十年的屎山，有什么真实的好处吗？rust和AI工程师，目前也比cobol老头贵的多。和技术爱好者相信的相反，几乎没有。工程师的审美和洁癖，在真实世界毫无意义。

- ## 其实最后用户愿意买单的产品还是一样的，真正能留住用户的还是那些精心打磨，真正好用的产品。有没有 vibe coding 都一样，只要用户的需求逻辑没变。
- https://x.com/yvbbrjdr/status/2024665256791019670
- 但是病毒营销出来的东西会被收购，套现离场

- 感觉产品的核心竞争力正在转变成对细节的打磨，因为复制创意越来越简单，可能几小时时间甚至更短就能出个可验证的 sample，但打磨细节到完成品需要额外的精力和时间, 虽说从 0 到 1 的乐趣被永远剥夺了

- 确实是这样，软件开发发展到内容农场的阶段

- ## 🤼🤔 Cloning any random piece of SaaS is something that could already be done before agentic coding, and the economics of it haven't changed meaningfully. 
- https://x.com/fchollet/status/2025283590972756284
  - Before, writing the clone would cost 0.5-1% of the valuation of the legacy SaaS company. Now it might be 0.1%. 
  - It doesn't make a difference -- if you can pull it off profitably today you could also have done it profitably in the past.
  - The code is a very small part of the process of making such a clone successful, and the reason legacy software has often bad UX is not because code was expensive to write.
- I genuinely think "code is now much easier to write and features are much easier to ship" strictly benefits legacy SaaS because it addresses their main weakness
  - The main threat to legacy SaaS is other legacy SaaS trying to move horizontally into their space because it is now easier to do so
- Circa 2012 you had a lot of devs "cloning Twitter" as a weekend project. Reproducing the UI and features of any app was never difficult and was never particularly valuable.

- I agree with this, and it explains why Meta would spend billions of dollars acquiring competitors rather than just building it themselves, which they could have done so easily.
  - However, I think there are examples of software which are just genuinely very difficult to build, even now with Vibe coding. It would still take many years to vibe code Adobe Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve/Fusion, or Unreal Engine again from scratch, even if you knew exactly "what" to build, and mimicking anything means you don't understand it in the same structural/phylogenetic way -- so you won't be able to creatively evolve it. 

- the workday example is perfect. google could clone it in a week. they don't because the value isn't in the code, it's in the compliance templates, the audit trails, the integration with 500 payroll providers, the decade of edge cases baked into business logic. vibecoders cloning saas UIs are solving the easy 5% and calling it disruption.

- Exactly. Code has never been the moat. Distribution, data network effects, switching costs, and trust are. Agentic coding lowers build cost, but it doesn’t magically give you customers, integrations, or brand credibility.

- The moat was never the code. It was distribution and switching costs. That math still holds.

- Problem of SaaS is not cloning. Their problem is that now I do not need many SaaS at all. I can just build things for myself or as internal tools for the company way cheaper than it was before
  - The reason people pay for SaaS is not just because of the effort of development

- ## [AnythingLLM Desktop works across your entire OS with local models : r/LocalLLaMA _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r8biu3/anythingllm_desktop_works_across_your_entire_os/)
  - Today, we released AnythingLLM Desktop v1.11.0 and it is a step towards our new direction that becomes more of an extension of your OS and less of a sandboxed app.
  - Now with a simple customized keybind you can open an overlay that instantly has access to your open apps and screen. This works for both multi-modal but also non-vision enabled models.
  - This functionality is all on top of all the stuff people use AnythingLLM for already: Chatting with documents, RAG, agents, MCPs, and more. This panel also has awareness of any Meeting transcripts you might have too!
  - This is all done using on-device models and pipelines - using a local model you can have a fully on-device experience. In that demo I am using Qwen3-VL 4B Instruct (Q4) on a Macbook M4 Pro but you can really bring in any model or provider you want.
  - We also have an OSS MIT license multi-user server based version of AnythingLLM if you are looking for something more hostable on a VM or something.
  - When you drag a file into the window (what type?) it parses them and adds them to the model. You can press CTRL/CMD+F and see the exact documents + token window usage of all documents. I am certainly able to drag and drop files and it certainly is pulling specific information out of them as well
- The installer is only ~400MB. Are you on Mac or Windows? The majority of the footprint likely is the meeting assistant stuff. We now have the installer ask first before pulling the model if you know youll never use it. We can do the same for the whole feature as well.
  - Then the other big bit is Ollama's CUDA/RoCM backend - which without will just have the built-in models run on CPU only.
  - I do plan to move the entire installer away from the old installer method and instead have the "select features" kind of UI where you can pick and choose what you want to install during setup - which then should get you to where you want total bundle size.

- How do you guarantee your solution against malicious prompt injection? If it has access to the entire computer, the fact that it's local doesn't guarantee data extraction.
  - It does not read your screen passively
  - "agentic" tasks that call APIs and do things like that require "@agent" in the prompt - this keeps regular chats and agentic chats separate within the same thread. AnythingLLM has always done this.
  - So the only way to prompt inject yourself and do something is to entirely execute a full self-own and really force it to happen. Its a non-issue.

- ## Interpreter. It's a desktop agent that can fill PDFs, edit your Excel and Word docs, and learn new skills. _202602
- https://x.com/hellokillian/status/2024227639087813035
  - Runs offline, works with any model, and it's free.
  - [Interpreter: The Desktop Agent](https://www.openinterpreter.com/)
  - my work is just more "files first" so wanted something that wasn't so chat-first. will extend this beyond office docs soon.

- 🐛 
  - 不选择文件的普通chat，无法查看历史

- does it handle multi-step tasks across multiple docs, or is it one file at a time?
  - multi-doc to the core. this was why we decided to bring the office editors into the app (as opposed to an Excel/Word extension) — so much work happens across documents
  - the agent is multi-doc, and the interface supports multi-pane layouts, so you can also be multi-doc!

- How do you see the interactions in the coming years? I believe we will possibly have a central database with logic for interacting with it.
  - I think of it the same way! most of the apps I use every day are simple structures under the hood:
  - contacts, notes, calendar, email, many more— are arrays of objects.
  - I imagine it becoming pretty annoying that they each have their own GUI and can't talk to eachother. 
  - the primary form of interaction might just be through an agent, which is capable of displaying those objects + some interactive controls for fast/granular manipulation.
  - exactly how we're approaching interpreter :) agent on the right, objects on the left, interfaces in the middle that the agent or user can control.
- Totally agree. And I think this applies to both B2C and B2B. Think about real daily workflows: you interact with calendars, finances, tasks, notes  and even when we connect these through APIs, there's still a fundamental piece missing: a central place where the relationships between things actually exist.
  - B2C example: a person has calendar, bank, notes, emails. Each app holds a piece. But none of them knows that "Tuesday's meeting is with the client who owes you money and who you noted last week is unhappy." That relationship doesn't exist anywhere.
  - B2B example: a company has ERP, CRM, logistics, finance. The same customer has a different ID in each system. Nobody knows that the customer who's buying less (ERP) is the same one who gave a low NPS (CRM) and received 3 late deliveries (logistics). The data islands exist, but the relationships between them don't.
  - What I believe: the future is a central database (SQL, graph, whatever) where the entities and relationships of a business or a person's life are actually modeled. The rules and connections live there. And the agent consumes that to act with full context  not stitching pieces from N apps together, but reading from a unified ontology.

- ## [Claude Co-Work is....meh unless you code : r/claude](https://www.reddit.com/r/claude/comments/1r6a11x/claude_cowork_ismeh_unless_you_code/)
  - I genuine tried to give this thing a shot. Outside of coding, its kind of just a glorified web-app that you can install locally.
  - Browsing the web? Unless its plain text, it struggles, fails, times out, gives up.
  - Want it to download files/pdf's? Nope. Can't do that, do it yourself.
  - It also regularly fails to find folders. How do you not see DOCUMENTS on a mac? Its right there...
  - It can't open more than one tab at a time.
  - It is stupid slow on all models.
  - At the end of the day, what ever you are doing on claude that isn't code, there is very little reason to pay to get cowork. It's not going to do anything it advertised if you aren't coding standalone agents.
  - Over all, it has potential, but in its current form, its too slow, too naggy, too annoying, too useless.
  - Being advertised as an actual "co-worker" you can hand off a bunch of work to and f*** off and come back and its mostly done, is so far from reality its not even funny.

- Co-work is great, to be honest. If they cancel that, I’ll drop my Claude subscription. I use it to write confluence docs, edit pdfs, word docs, create contracts, amend them, do P&l stuff, powerpoint presentation, even google slides via chrome mcp. You’re using it wrong OP.

- I think the idea is that many more non coders in the near future will do small coding activities in their jobs. If that’s not you, it’s not for you. But it might be for your replacement

- ## What agentic coding methods seem to have done is reduced the cost of replicating previous-generation methods. 
- https://x.com/dustingetz/status/2025191981207421346
  - But without developing new frameworks, the agentic methods will simply reproduce the same set of flaws and issues that the current generation of growth stage products have. Which means they are (1) uncompetitive, and (2) late. 
  - The fundamental problem of software is that it becomes difficult to change once you have users and revenue. 
  - Being 100x faster to generate code does not solve that problem that landing the code in prod breaks the user's workflow and generates churn(搅乳器).
  - Agentic coding methods also accelerate research and development, so I anticipate a new generation of more agile products. But still, these will be built by more competent founders, not less. AI reduces switching costs and accelerates learning. The advantage right now is to R&D teams that figure out how to take advantage of the new capability frontier to accelerate their very slow R&D lifecycle.

- ## [I looked into OpenClaw architecture to dig some details : r/LLMDevs _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLMDevs/comments/1r9136z/i_looked_into_openclaw_architecture_to_dig_some/)
  - Under the hood, it’s simpler than most people expect.
  - OpenClaw runs as a persistent Node.js process on your machine. There’s a single Gateway that binds to localhost and manages all messaging platforms at once: WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord. Every message flows through that one process. It handles authentication, routing, session loading, and only then passes control to the agent loop. Responses go back out the same path. No distributed services. No vendor relay layer.
  - What makes it feel different from ChatGPT-style tools is persistence. It doesn’t reset. Conversation history, instructions, tools, even long-term memory are just files under ~/clawd/. Markdown files. No database. You can open them, version them, diff them, roll them back. The agent reloads this state every time it runs, which is why it remembers what you told it last week.
  - The heartbeat mechanism is the interesting part. A cron wakes it up periodically, runs cheap checks first (emails, alerts, APIs), and only calls the LLM if something actually changed. That design keeps costs under control while allowing it to be proactive. It doesn’t wait for you to ask.
  - The security model is where things get real. The system assumes the LLM can be manipulated. So enforcement lives at the Gateway level: allow lists, scoped permissions, sandbox mode, approval gates for risky actions. But if you give it full shell and filesystem access, you’re still handing a probabilistic model meaningful control. The architecture limits blast radius, it doesn’t eliminate it.
  - What stood out to me is that nothing about OpenClaw is technically revolutionary. The pieces are basic: WebSockets, Markdown files, cron jobs, LLM calls. The power comes from how they’re composed into a persistent, inspectable agent loop that runs locally.
  - It’s less “magic AI system” and more “LLM glued to a long-running process with memory and tools.”

- That persistence feature is possibly the most important advantage AI agents have over chat interfaces imo

- One of the most important components at the core of OpenClaw is another open source project called Pi and Pi is responsible for a large portion of the heavy lifting in OpenClaw.
  - Pi has a number on components in its mono repo (pi-mono) but the 2 most relevant to OpenClaw’s success are the Agent and Coding-Agent.

- ## 🤔 [I feel left behind. What is special about OpenClaw? : r/LocalLLaMA _202602](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1r9gve8/i_feel_left_behind_what_is_special_about_openclaw/)
  - While there are tools like Manus ai, It seems like everyone is excited about OpenClaw lately, and I genuinely don’t fully understand the differentiation. What exactly is the shift here? Is it UX, architecture, control layer, distribution? Not criticizing, just trying to understand what I’m missing.

- Astroturfing
  - While I do agree, the local agentic nature of it (and messenger API integration) is quite a nice package.
  - I've been running it on my M4 Mac Mini, and sending it on little tasks has been interesting to say the least.

- First there was just a chat window. ctrl c, ctrl v.
  - Then came agentic coding that not only did ctrl c and v for you, also read the files that mattered.
  - Then came identity and memories, an md files that explains everything in enough depth and the AI got a headstart.
  - Then we started having context window problems, we stick everything in context, and lots of fails because models werent as smart as today. Plus they tend to forget about things that even do fit in context.

- I use OpenClaw daily. The main difference vs other agent frameworks is that it's a unified runtime with persistent workspace, not just a chat wrapper.
  - Tools are first-class: browser, shell, code execution, file system access, all in one environment with a shared context
  - Skills system lets you extend capabilities with structured tool definitions
  - Memory persistence across sessions via local markdown files the agent can read/write
  - The heartbeat system lets agents be proactive, not just reactive
  - Multi-channel (I can message it via Telegram, Discord, etc and it maintains state)
  - It's less "AI that can use tools" and more "environment where AI has access to everything." The tradeoff is you're trusting it with real access, which is why the security model matters.

- Don't. It's a security nightmare.
- OpenClaw is bad software. It is intrinsically unsecure, and prone to prompt injection attacks. Giving it access to your desktop or accounts is hazardous and profoundly unwise.
  - The only reason it has seen so much buzz is because of a massive bot-driven astroturfing campaign, which unfortunately enough people fell for to keep the buzz rolling.

- Of course openclaw has great risk, but it also has great potential

- I think social media hype is a part of the equation. But it's also how easy it is for "normal" people to cook up some automation with it.
  - It's hard enough that they feel like they have expertise (e.g., writing markdown, setting schedule), but not too "hard" that they just give up like playing with n8n, langflow, or writing a script for cronjob. 
  - That "simplicity" comes with great costs though. In this case, costs is literal in terms of Opus token burning, and overall finicky nature of the automation they built. 

- Nothing, it's just a token-burning, social-media generated, ai-hype engine. Doesn't do or mean anything at all.

- IMO it’s an experiment in giving a coding agent long-term memory, and control over its execution environment. It has memory, it has agency, and it has hooks and mechanisms to initiate conversations, not just respond. It’s a really powerful harness, to the point people have shot themselves in the foot with it.

- Open Interpreter has been around for a while. It's like Mistral vibe but it can run code and do anything on your computer.

- That's why I love the project and support it - someone had the insight, courage, and drive to finally assemble all the puzzle pieces: an agent (pi), MCP and skills and numerous CLI tools (many of which he built himself), a memory system, scheduler and IM gateways. All that released as open source - and even after getting hired by OpenAI, he's not selling out the project, but letting it live on in a foundation.

- Malware bot platform that is being popularised by the bots themselves.

- It’s a tool that will leak all your information

- ## [Google 封号的最大起因 Openclaw这类的兴起 _202602](https://linux.do/t/topic/1631197)
- 主要还是使用的人多了吧，之前使用 Claude Code 不也一样吗。只是 openclaw 让用的人多了，毕竟之前使用 Claude Code 人不多吧
  - 写代码的比较人少，claw 这类人人都可以用，数量就指数级增加了

- ## 从 CompanyOS 到 LifeOS - 将文件系统哲学应用于人生管理
- https://x.com/yibie/status/2021778995185168650
  - Eli Mernit 提出将公司建模为文件系统，让 AI Agent 通过读写文件来运营企业。这条思路的深层价值在于：当个人也将人生建模为文件系统时，它不仅是一种极简高效的人生管理哲学，更让 Openclaw 等 AI Agent 能够真正成为你的"数字分身"——因为它们可以像访问公司数据一样，访问你完整的人生上下文。
- "One reason that rolling out agents at enterprises is complicated is because data is siloed across many different systems."
  - 没有共享的命名空间 (shared namespace)，AI Agent 无法获得完整的上下文，自然无法做出好的决策。
- Eli 的解决方案极具 Unix 哲学的美感： 把整个公司建模为一个统一的文件系统。
  - 统一命名空间：所有数据映射到文件路径Agent 可以访问所需的一切
  - 文件即状态：公司状态 = 文件内容状态管理极简、透明
  - 权限即治理：组织架构 = Unix 权限权限边界清晰、自动化
  - 读写即操作：Agent 通过读写文件工作接口简单、可审计

- 如果你想开始构建自己的人生文件系统，以下是一些工具思路：
基础工具
Obsidian - 本地 Markdown 笔记，图谱视图
Logseq - 大纲式笔记，日记导向
VS Code + Git - 代码编辑器管理人生文件
同步与访问
Syncthing - 点对点文件同步
Nextcloud - 自托管云存储
GitHub Private Repos - 版本控制人生文件
AI 集成
Openclaw - 文件系统优先的 AI Agent
Claude Code - 可以直接操作文件的 AI
数据迁移
从各 App 导出数据（大多数支持）
转换为 Markdown / JSON / CSV
导入统一的人生文件系统

- 👥

- 这里面的挑战是，未来这些信息是一个本地的系统，还是一个云端的系统。是集中化的，还是数据分散但是通过agent集中起来的。留在本地的这一整套都不是终极形态
  - 未来和 OpenClaw 开发者所说的，SaaS 服务会再度抽象成一个个 bot，然后 bot-2-bot 相互沟通提供服务。可视化设计只不过是面向人类，而 bot 是不需要的。 所以，无论当前的界面是否消亡，面向人类的 GUI 和让数据联通的 API 都不会消失。

- MCP will die this 2026. MD files and CLI will be the substitute

- 2026 is the year protocols become the primary interface. Humans aren’t browsing. Agents are. They follow standards, authenticate, and transact autonomously.

- ## [老saas焕新的讨论 ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1607336)
  - 有没有办法，可以把老旧的 web based 的 saas 系统，升级成 AI driven 的新的 saas 系统？ 我能想到的一种方式是，前端提供对话框，LLM prompts 里提前对业务系统的表结构进行理解（saas 一般都是结构化数据），text2sql，然后对查出来的数据，在前端通过 llm 进行展示（这种形式最容易想到，也容易被 sql 注入，大家还有没有别的方法）
- 我觉得目前的 AI 还不够智能和安全，我的想法是在现有的 SaaS 系统基础上做一个外挂，通过 MCP 让 agent 能够调用后端接口，而不是直接去操作数据库，相当于是替代前端，这是我觉得目前阶段比较稳妥的做法。
- 具体怎么操作也看 SaaS 的架构吧，我这边是基于 Go 的后端，就接入 Go 的 MCP 库，你可以理解成把现在的 restful api 给翻译为 MCP 接口，专门让 agent 进行调用的。
  - 然后 agent 这一块是另一套工程方向了，简单的话可以用 dify、coze 搭建工作流接入后端的 mcp 服务器，复杂的话也可以用 python/Go 或者 langchain 之类的框架做 agent 开发，这块比较复杂

- 好想法，甚至可以把一些业务动作封装成 skills

- 可以的，老哥这个想法比我的靠谱多了，那你觉得前端应该用什么形式呢，chatbot？而且 mcp agent 的话，怎么鉴权呢，比如不同的权限级别能调用的 api 应该是不同的
  - 前端 chatbot 最简单高效，反正我目前是在原有前端界面右下角有个按钮弹出对话框，就像那些客服机器人一样。
  - 鉴权直接接入现有 SaaS 的权限管理呗。
- 理论上只要能把用户的 token 从 agent 通过 mcp 传到后端就行，会不会有问题我也不敢百分之百肯定，可能不同语言的 mcp 实现不一样呢

- 总感觉这里可以通过提示词提权
  - 提不了，大模型也只是调接口而已

- ## [Fully offline, privacy-first AI transcription & assistant app. Is there a market for this? : r/LocalLLM](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1qz80a9/fully_offline_privacyfirst_ai_transcription/)
- Entirely dependent on the minimum specs required to run it and the platforms it runs on.
  - If I can run it on an integrated graphics Intel CPU from the last five years or so with say only 8-16gb of RAM it could be a winner. Or thinks Mac M1 with 8gb of RAM. This is 80% of computers that real people use daily. 
  - If it needs 24gb of VRAM and 16 CPU cores then it's a niche market... Not sure I like your chances. 
- It’s actually 100% standalone on mobile! No PC or server tethering required. The whole point is to have a fully offline assistant right in your pocket, taking advantage of the NPU/GPU on modern smartphones.
- Yes, like whisper locally but mobile, and I connected an LLM that gives you suggestions or translates or summarizes in real time. What do you think?
  - I use whisper regularly. That's why I was asking, what's the big deal? Personally I don't need summaries or translations, but those might be the major attraction for some people, saving them time.
- I use LoroNote for whisper local transcription on my phone. If you could do real time streaming transcription, ESPECIALLY with diarization (separating who is speaking) then that would be an absolute game changer.

- Here seems to be a ready-made one that supports multiple platforms including iOS/macOS. https://www.kyoten.jp/products/safe-translator/

- ## 高强度使用了 openclaw, 离开了它丑丑的 UI 我发现 openclaw 最牛逼的地方就是它是一个高度 AI Native 的系统（拜托于各式各样的 skills）
- https://x.com/yetone/status/2020875192923558026
  - ai native: 完全发挥 AI 的主观能动性，不需要用户操作任何的 UI 控件，只通过聊天让 AI 完成所有的操作
- 其实并不是因为 UI 丑，而是他本身就是一个 Headless AI Native 产品，如果真的说有 UI 的话，那 IM 就是他的 UI 了。他的出现其实给很多 agent 产品一个启示，agent 最适合的载体就是 IM，因为可以随时随地唤起。

- 没错Alma是有层层叠叠的UI树和对化设置的，要让设置能通过对话和记忆，自己设置自己
  - 接下来的几个版本，Alma 逐渐进化到 skill base 的系统，大家都不需要通过任何 UI 点击就能完成所有的 Alma 的配置工作

- ## 🤔💡 软件正在走一条，媒体已经走过的老路。当成本塌陷，一个行业的价值结构一定会整体翻转。
- https://x.com/AztecaAlpaca/status/2020013931499278370
  - 一旦软件像内容一样“便宜到不需要赚钱”，后果就会出现：
  - 软件数量会爆炸，单个大而全的系统价值下降，用户不会再依赖某一个“巨无霸软件”，而是用一堆小工具、临时工具、自动生成的东西，按当下需求拼起来用。
  - Salesforce 不会被下一个 Salesforce 干掉，而会被一堆“临时有效、随用随生”的东西慢慢掏空；真正掌权的，会是新的平台，负责分发、组合、调度这些软件。
  - 在互联网出现之前，媒体的运行方式完全不同。内容生产成本很高：要付钱请人创作、编辑、发行。正因如此，内容必须赚钱。消费者也确实为此付费——报纸、杂志、书籍、有线电视、按次点播。沃伦·巴菲特曾公开表示自己热爱报纸生意，谁会不喜欢一种订阅稳定、又具备地方性垄断结构的商业模式呢？
  - 当互联网出现时，媒体公司把它看成扩大受众、降低分发成本的工具。但几乎没人预料到，互联网不只是把分发成本压到零，同时也把内容创作成本推向了零。用户生成内容开始繁荣。当内容不再需要成本，它也就不再需要赚钱。
  - 用户生成内容平台。这些平台对传统媒体形成了侧面撞击。作为一家媒体公司，你争夺的是同样的用户注意力，却承担着更高的单位成本。雇佣的人越多、原创内容团队越大，越容易被用户生成内容平台从侧翼包抄。从结构上看，投资媒体此后一直是一个持续失血的选择，价值创造已经完全转移到掌控分发的平台手中。
  - 软件的情况长期以来类似。软件昂贵，是因为需要人来开发、维护和分发。正因为昂贵，软件必须赚钱。我们为此付费——软件授权、SaaS、按席位定价等。历史上，软件行业的利润率令人艳羡：90%以上的毛利率，分发的边际成本几乎为零。
  - 软件之所以昂贵，是因为开发者昂贵。他们是高技能的“翻译者”，在人的语言与计算机语言之间来回切换。大语言模型已经证明自己在这件事上极其高效，并将把软件的创建成本推向零。
  - 当软件不再需要赚钱时，会发生什么？我们将经历一次软件的寒武纪大爆发，正如当年内容所经历的一样。
  - 《Vogue》并没有被另一家时尚媒体取代，它被一万个网红取代。
  - Salesforce 也不会被另一个庞大的 CRM 系统替代，它会被一组动态组合的工具所取代，这些工具共同服务于相同的意图与痛点。
  - 软件公司将以与媒体公司相同的方式被取代，同时催生出一批新的、掌控分发权的平台。
  - SaaS、ARR、各种“魔法数字”，都是旧软件商业模式的速记方式。在那个模型里，软件开发成本本身构成了护城河。长期以来，市场的“无形之手”在软件行业被人为压制；而 LLM 将引入一次迅速而熟悉的纠偏。今天选择计算机科学作为专业，处境将类似于 90 年代末选择新闻学。

- 做出优秀的软件是个严肃的工程任务，但是人们需求并不需要优秀的软件就可以满足了
  - 比如科研工作者，他们的代码质量总体上是很糟糕的，尤其是做数学和做物理的，代码风格简直臭名昭著... 但是，对他们而言，有个凑活能用的代码来解决计算需求已经够了。
- 人们在许多时候对软件的需求甚至连demo都够不上。以前只能通过购买某个软件来满足这种需求，现在直接AI生成一个简单的脚本就搞定了（就像有个高级一点的计算器）。

- 🤔 不是软件变得很多，是语言文字图片的input转向了不需要用软件，而是用skills，或直接mcp解决问题，但是对于大公司，mcp向数据库请求资源，和以什么样式回馈给用户，还是需要构架的，数据库的关系，还是需要构架的，以前，人类需要前后端UI显示和查询数据库，现在不是了
  - Salesforce确实有很大影响，但是对于复杂的任务，很难，而对于简单的项目，比如报税，intuit就很快就会被干掉，只要大多数人可以用skills. 但你别指望不会写代码的人能马上上手terminal CLI. 更别指望不懂数据关系的人上手用母语编程

- 软件行业的“媒体化”已经开始了。但媒体还有一个课很少人提：当内容免费后，赌的就是分发。谁能把软件送到用户面前，谁就赢。App Store 就是这个模式下最大的赢家。
  - 🤔 分发渠道是否是 skill/mcp marketplace

- 🤔 还可以参考 智能手机 干掉 mp3/相机/导航仪 的市场逻辑
  - ai正在将垂直领域的产品封装为一个个插件
- cowork太通用
  - 阿里垂直场景的工具可以调用国产软件，如金税系统、教育、医疗、法律

- 媒体翻转后留下了碎片化和垃圾信息洪水，软件翻转后，我们会不会面临‘逻辑洪水’？当工具便宜到不需要钱，我们是不是反而会被无数低质、临时的逻辑补丁给淹没？
  - 有可能吧，现在已经进入了一个发布之后就不再维护的时代了，和传媒的那种管拉不管擦的局面差不多了

- 维护一个能用的工具是要花费精力和人力的, 用来挣钱的工具, 为什么要倾向于自己造方案?  既然生产成本很低, 更应该往供应商多提定制需求
  - 文中一个比较核心的观点：“当软件不再需要赚钱时”... 你说的都是不得不以赚钱为目标的软件。但很多情况下，我写个代码只是为了解决我手头的问题，不需要赚钱

- ## [从“为什么ai客户端都不支持多窗口多开”看到ai开发的未来 _202602](https://linux.do/t/topic/1576098)
  - Cherry Studio 桌面客户端不支持多开窗口 这个问题已经反应了一年了，作者还回复了，也开看见了，LobeHub 也是 作者也知道，也一年了，知道现在一个这些主流 ai 客户端就没一个支持多窗口多开的
  - 这些客户端大部分都是 chrome 架构的，本质就是个网页，多窗口多开本质不就是一个代码开关的问题，真有这么难，就没人做的出来，还是作者极度的傲慢？
  - 我之前看 win 多屏用户人群超过 30% 了，这么多人使用多显示器
  - 尤其是在写东西查资料的的时候两个标签反复的切换 我另一个屏幕就哪里空着用不上 真是用的脑袋疼 太恶心了
  - 尤其是不同的 ai 还需要先切换助手在点击对话 切换一次要点四五次，我很难理解这些人做出来的产品到底自己用不用

- ## OpenClaw 可以算是 AI OS 的雏形了吧，或者叫 AI DOS：
- https://x.com/geekbb/status/2019591292456759564
  - Skills → 应用软件
  - 终端 → Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp 
  - 进程管理 → Agentic Workflow / Task Planning
  - 指令集 → 自然语言
  - 虚拟内存与分页 → RAG
- 这个类比很到位，尤其是叫 AI DOS ，现在的交互确实还挺硬核的。如果 RAG 是虚拟内存，那 Context Window 应该就是死贵的 L1 缓存？好奇谁能先搞出 AI 界的 Windows 95。

- ## [畅想一下未来，以后充token会不会就像充流量话费 ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1552655)
- 如果能的话我觉得还是挺值得入的，无限 token 但到指定 token 数额之后限制上下文

- 要出不限量 不降智 老百姓用的起

- 以 v3.2 的价格，可能加起来价格不如话费贵。

- 从 3g 时代，用多少充多少。到后来套餐包月。最后进化到卫星 wifi，实现 token 自由

- ## [【Agent系列4】Clawdbot（Moltbot）全球爆火的底层原理  ](https://linux.do/t/topic/1541126/3)
  - moltbot 这么火，说明其赛道 (本地桌面 agent) 是被压抑的需求，如果其种种问题都解决了，桌面 agent 显然是功能最强大的，人能做啥他就能做啥
  - 其他所有 CLI，虚拟机，远程服务器，浏览器 Agent，IDE agent，app agent，本质都是脱裤子放屁，舍近求远，桌面 agent 才是那个房间里的大象，但人人都装看不见。
  - 远程虚拟机 CLI Agent (Manus) 某种角度就像我用 ipad 遥控自己电脑一样迟钝和束手束脚
  - 远程虚拟机 CLI Agent（Manus）的情况 虚拟机里没有用户隐私，格式化了对用户也没影响，重开一个虚拟机好了
  - Cloud Agent (如 Manus) 为什么好做？因为它运行在标准化的 Docker 容器里。 屏幕分辨率是固定的 (1920x1080)，浏览器版本是锁死的，字体渲染是统一的。
  - Moltbot 建议用 Mac mini 这类备用电脑 / 独立电脑，或者淘汰的 MacBook 因为不是工作机，没必要个性化，甚至建议用相同版本 macOS，相同的默认界面，来对抗桌面 UI 个性化的造成的适配性灾难

- ## 国外有类似大众点评这类专注于评价/打分的网站吗? 可以列举些 互联网服务或 效率/生产力工具 评价相关网站并给出该网站评价体系相关的指标, 要非餐饮行业的评价类网站
- Letterboxd makes money primarily through its tiered subscription model (Pro and Patron) offering ad-free viewing and advanced features, targeted advertising for film studios and distributors (especially for new releases), and specialized "HQ" accounts for film organizations, all while leveraging its engaged, cinema-literate user base as a valuable marketing channel. 
  - remove ads, get detailed stats, stream availability tools, watchlist notifications, and profile customization.
  - HQ Accounts: Film-related businesses (studios, festivals, podcasts) pay for special accounts to post news, link to external sites

- ## I suddenly use the @NotionHQ agent a lot. Use cases
- https://x.com/cramforce/status/2012890889803399504
  - I dump a long list of Slack-sourced one-sentence ideas. The agent categorize them
  - I write competitive research table, the agent fills it out and adds appendixes with detailed data
  - I love this because it saves me time but the use-cases are low-risk of hallucination AND I don't get paragraphs of slop-text that pains me to read

- Notion as the “messy inbox to structured doc” layer is such a good use of an agent. Categorize the chaos, then fill the table, then append sources. The time saved is obvious, but the bigger win is everyone reads the same format.

- I actually could use something like this but for Obsidian

- ## [类似 Manus 的开源项目有哪些 _202601](https://linux.do/t/topic/1465345)
  - Manus 好用但是不能爽用
  - 流畅度是最重要的，我闭源的工具我都没用过比 Manus 流畅的, 调用工具这块 Manus 还是太强了
- 要类似 Manus 这样：
  - 可以调用终端
  - 调用浏览器
  - 能执行 js 脚本
  - 能调用联网工具
  - 支持浏览器视觉
  - Python 爬虫爬取内容

- cli工具都可以，开源的有opencode gemini cli这些，国内那几个不知道开源了没

- 这个是 Gemini cli 的 GUI 吧，很多终端上能用的功能在 aionui 就不能用了
  - aionui俺这个还不太行，基于gemini cli魔改的，目前能力都在终端上，浏览器的话，得装 chrome-dev-tool之类的MCP进行调用。
  - 对话的时候，点这个关联文件夹，授予gemini cli访问权限

- ## 🆚 [Is there any tool for for manual proofreading of video transcriptions, with ability to check original audio and to maintain a list (dictionary) of text entities? : r/LanguageTechnology _202404](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1c3qfii/is_there_any_tool_for_for_manual_proofreading_of/)
- https://gooey.ai/speech offers a bunch of ASR models (google USM, meta-large, whisper v3) and the ability to define a dictionary as a google sheet.

- I'm not sure this is actually an NLP problem. Everything you want here can be done with standard text editors and databases and probably some audio software, you just want an app that puts all of that together. The actual NLP task of transcribing the audio is the part you're doing manually, rather than delegating it to an algorithm to do automatically.

- ## "We now want to edit our *tools* as we have previously edited our documents"
- https://x.com/geoffreylitt/status/1646688665479831559
- "As we shape our tools, our tools shape us." 
- This is what makes tools like Notion and Airtable so powerful— they’re lightweight ways to build increasingly customizable interfaces with (albeit small) knowledge databases. As they get more flexible and can handle more data, I feel they’ll become essential parts of UI/UX design
