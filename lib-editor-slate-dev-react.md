- By default, the Editable component comes with a set of event handlers that handle typical rich-text editing behaviors (for example, it implements its own onCopy, onPaste, onDrop, and onKeyDown handlers).
  - In some cases you may want to extend or override Slate's default behavior, which can be done by passing your own event handler(s) to the Editable component.
