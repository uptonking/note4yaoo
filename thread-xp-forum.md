- ## atom-editor: Why Discourse instead of Github Issues?
- https://discuss.atom.io/t/why-discourse-instead-of-github-issues/3986
- On the Atom team we use GitHub Issues primarily for bug tracking. 
  - We wanted a public forum for people to discuss features, packages, themes and other things that are different from bugs. 
  - We stumbled upon discourse 270 and really liked it, so we are trying it out!
