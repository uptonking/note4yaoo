- Technical limits 🛑
  - ⚠️ Execution Time: Each flow has a maximum execution time of 600 seconds (10 minutes). Flows exceeding this limit will be marked as a timeout.
    - Flow run in a paused state, such as Wait for Approval or Delay, do not count toward the 600 seconds.
    - The execution time limit can be worked around by splitting the flows into multiple ones, such as by having one flow call another flow using a webhook, or by having each flow process a small batch of items.
  - ⚠️ Memory Usage: During execution, a flow should not use more than 128 MB of RAM.
  - ⚠️ Maximum File Size: 10 MB
    - The files from actions or triggers are stored in the database/S3 to support retries from certain steps.
  - ⚠️ Some pieces utilize the built-in Activepieces key store, such as the Store Piece and Queue Piece.
    - Maximum Key Length: 128 characters
    - Maximum Value Size: 512 KB

- features
  - Human in the Loop: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. 
  - Builder Features: Loops, Branches, Auto Retries, HTTP
  - Keep It Simple: accessible for everyone, regardless of their background and technical expertise
  - Keep It Extensible: Automation pieces framework has minimal abstraction and allow you to extend for any usecase

# draft
- workflow ui by maxgraph/logicFlow

- bpmn adapter/pieces
# dev-xp
- published flow在off状态也会一直执行?
  - 似乎与flow重命名相关，在flow列表重命名后，存在旧flow和新flow同时执行的问题
  - 临时方案是，手动设置为off，再设置为on
