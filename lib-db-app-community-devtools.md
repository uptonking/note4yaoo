- ## [Beekeeper Studio SQL editor 4.0 â€“ Import. backup, restore, and bigquery | Hacker News _202310](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37732329)
- Been using this for a year or so as my daily basic DB client. Really like it for what it is and can definitely recommend it for quick and simple DB operations.
  - I put it in the same category as tableplus - its a nice simple db client when all you need to do is browse some data, edit a row or two, etc. The community edition of beekeeper, however, has less annoyances than tableplus's free version imo.
  - For more advanced use-cases, it doesn't come close to dbeaver or tools like that, but it also isn't designed to imo.

- Does anyone know how this compares to DBeaver?
  - Smoother to use and simpler, but it's missing features when it comes to running long queries where you want to break it up into several so it does not timeout.

- I made Beekeeper Studio because the lack of a good SQL editor on Linux drove me crazy. TablePlus is great on MacOS, but when I started it didn't even have a Linux version.
  - I have full feature parity across all OSes, which I'm pretty proud of as a one-man team (although I do have some AMAZING part time help)

- Almost all Electron-based software has a guilt(æœ‰ç½ª; è¿‡å¤±) of shortcuts. By either not having them at all, or by using the scheme alien to a particular OS. Obsidian is my personal pit peeve - it still has a spotty support of F2 (rename) shortcut on Windows. Previously, it hadn't it at all.

- It's a similar value proposition as VSCode/Sublime Text vs IntelliJ. If you are in a database all day and need a big beefy IDE, Beekeeper Studio isn't for you.
  - I built Beekeeper Studio because I wanted an easy to use and intuitive GUI. I'm not a DBA, so using DBeaver or DataGrip required me to basically re-learn the whole app every time I used it, which I didn't have the patience for.

- See also: DBeaver, pgadmin, MySQL workbench, Navicat, MS Access, ... 
  - These graphical database clients mostly end up looking the same in the end
