- ## [Help me to choose between TypeORM or Mongoose for MongoDB_202202](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nestjs_framework/comments/swzr9y/help_me_to_choose_between_typeorm_or_mongoose_for/)
- Mongoose. In my experience TypeORM not have great support to MongoDB.
- I think one of the reasons to use ORMs is to make databse agnostic. But I dont think there are many cases of switching from NoSQL to RDBMS (or just any switch in general) after deployment (maybe migrate during dev).
- I would additionally suggest you to use mongoose over typegoose. Typegoose and the documentation was a pain, we had to switch to mongoose
- I've tried typeORM and mongoose, I think mongoose are good in doc. and simple for the beginner.
  - TypeORM the doc is not good. and will have a lot of tiny issues. It's not good to be a tool.
