- ## ðŸ‘£ jupyter notebook/livebook but focused entirely on SQL - who is gonna build this
- https://x.com/thdxr/status/1798422000320602496
- Databricks does this. Downside is that you have to setup databricks. But if youâ€™re anyways using it -> no extra friction

- jupyter notebook is language agnostic but you would need a kernel for SQL
- Jupyter already works pretty well w/ jupysql

- Whatâ€™s your exact use case? I have a Jupyter template set-up to ingest from S3 or local paths, and use DuckDB to write sql for querying. I could likely customize it to fit your use case more specifically(data source, query interface, etc).

- I used to type SQL in jupyter cells. a package called jupysql may be exactly what you're looking for

- I think @YousefED is pretty close already with http://typecell.org, though it does a lot more than sql I guess

- isn't this just metabase? or tableau

- try deepnote

- JetBrains DataSpell?

- Feel like DBeaver is pretty close to this already. I use it to run, test, and store SQL queries.
