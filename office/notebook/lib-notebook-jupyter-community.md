- ## I think notebook-like UIs are the best medium for generative AI rn.

  - Notebooks are rich in context & context-aware by design, familiar, and inherently exploratory
- One very cool piece of AI-UI that departs a bit from the notebook paradigm is Infinite Tech: https://infinite.tech
  - Kind of like a mutable notebook grid, where you can connect different cells/panels to different agents/datasets and setup an agent system geometrically.
- Built an open-source Jupyter Notebook that brings the power of @OpenAI's code interpreter into your local Python development environment.

- ## 👣 jupyter notebook/livebook but focused entirely on SQL - who is gonna build this

- Databricks does this. Downside is that you have to setup databricks. But if you’re anyways using it -> no extra friction

- jupyter notebook is language agnostic but you would need a kernel for SQL
- Jupyter already works pretty well w/ jupysql

- What’s your exact use case? I have a Jupyter template set-up to ingest from S3 or local paths, and use DuckDB to write sql for querying. I could likely customize it to fit your use case more specifically(data source, query interface, etc).

- I used to type SQL in jupyter cells. a package called jupysql may be exactly what you're looking for

- I think @YousefED is pretty close already with http://typecell.org, though it does a lot more than sql I guess

- isn't this just metabase? or tableau

- try deepnote

- JetBrains DataSpell?

- Feel like DBeaver is pretty close to this already. I use it to run, test, and store SQL queries.
