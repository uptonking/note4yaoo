- ## We're excited to launch real-time collaboration on Observable!__202103
- https://twitter.com/nebrius/status/1370067809955315714
- Tell us how did you do that, what are those tech parts and libs which helped?
  - üëâüèª We upgraded to **CodeMirror 6** and we're using their new collab module to handle local reconciliation
  - We then sync changes to/from the client through our servers using web sockets.
  - Observable already uses web sockets for syncing notebooks (you can see this when you open a notebook in two browser windows and edit one of them), so we only needed to add a few new messages to sync uncommitted changes and user presence.
- Does CodeMirror's OT model allow you to hold changes until they're syntactically correct on both sides?
  - That should be possible (the timing and implementation of sending changes is left to your integration code, so it can hold off until some condition is satisfied).
  - (Of course, the result of merging two concurrent syntactically-valid changes may still be syntactically invalid.)

- ## it's too easy to get stuck in an infinite loop with autorun enabled. 
- https://twitter.com/zxch3n/status/1600659901080297472
  - if natto guesses you're writing a loop, it'll now automatically disable autorun.
- CodePen solved this by injecting custom code into loops if I remember correctly. The code will abort the loop if it takes too long to run
- yep! that's the most robust approach but i'd like to avoid injecting code if possible (1. needs to load parser before code can run. 2. changes runtime behavior)

- ## One great thing about using @observablehq is that I am not "locked in". 
- https://twitter.com/steren/status/1525226330039521280
  - notebooks can be exported in idiomatic JavaScript, and later loaded on my own website:

- ## To help investigate userspace bugs in long running @observablehq notebooks, I used @mootari 's access-runtime notebook to create a notebook state snapshot function. 
- https://twitter.com/tomlarkworthy/status/1508384106937303043
  - Now you get a readout of all the cells and their current state, and value is availible.

- ## Anyone seen any good patterns for running automated tests in an @observablehq notebook?

- If ya looking for more end-to-end or integration tests: https://github.com/asg017/observable-prerender
  - Otherwise, abstracting your JS code into a separate package is always cool, or moving your data processing into a node script is also helpful

- ## Observable‚Äôs Not JavaScript_201906
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20184181
- I kinda want Observable to be it's own language that can compile to JS
  - And it kinda is. We provide a parser¬π and a runtime¬≤, and you can download a copy of any notebook compiled to a JavaScript module
  - That said, we‚Äôre explicitly designing for the reactivity of the notebook environment. 
- What's the rationale for results above code?
  - On Observable, each cell is a unit that can be evaluated independently, with two sides to it ‚Äî you have the source code editor, and you have the rendered display (either a chunk of DOM or canvas that you‚Äôve drawn, or an interactive inspector for JS values).
  - Now, the important thing is that the code half of the cell is often collapsed. 
  - If the code is on top, the entire cell jumps when it opens and closes, pushing the rendered display up and down. 
  - If the code is on the bottom, it emerges from the half of the cell that is always there, and the display is stable.
  - the rendered value as primary and the source code as secondary.
- Non-linear is a plus. Why force an order. Spreadsheet is non-linear and it works pretty well
- Clicking to reveal can be simply addressed with a global Expand-All toggle.
- What I'm talking about is editing code with Vim-like keys INSIDE the cells. An implementation of the Ace Editor or something similar would be amazing.
  - We use CodeMirror and are considering the vim bindings, but it‚Äôd probably be something we launch at the same time as user-configurable key bindings.
