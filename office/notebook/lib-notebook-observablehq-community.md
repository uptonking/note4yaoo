- ## We're excited to launch real-time collaboration on Observable!__202103
- https://twitter.com/nebrius/status/1370067809955315714
- Tell us how did you do that, what are those tech parts and libs which helped?
  - üëâüèª We upgraded to **CodeMirror 6** and we're using their new collab module to handle local reconciliation
  - We then sync changes to/from the client through our servers using web sockets.
  - Observable already uses web sockets for syncing notebooks (you can see this when you open a notebook in two browser windows and edit one of them), so we only needed to add a few new messages to sync uncommitted changes and user presence.
- Does CodeMirror's OT model allow you to hold changes until they're syntactically correct on both sides?
  - That should be possible (the timing and implementation of sending changes is left to your integration code, so it can hold off until some condition is satisfied).
  - (Of course, the result of merging two concurrent syntactically-valid changes may still be syntactically invalid.)

- ## I appreciate the nod to "File over app" from @mbostock and the @observablehq team in the latest announcement.
- https://twitter.com/kepano/status/1758202572446581025
  - It's so cool that a Markdown file with code blocks can be the source for complex data visualizations and dashboards. This means the files are interoperable with @obsdmd .
- Your post strengthened my conviction in this evolution of Observable. Interoperability for the win!! Thanks for trying Framework, too.
- Probably worth mentioning @evidence_dev , a BI library integrating markdown and SQL for elegant data analytics and visualization

- ## @observablehq 2.0 defines a file format, local support, and open source framework
- https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1758142768877023451
- If I understand this correctly, the (evolving) business model here is analogous to making the compiler for a language free, but offering an IDE as a subscription service. http://Observablehq.com is still the way we're expected to develop, in our browsers. I hope this works out.
- looks excellent. notebooks have never really clicked for me as a non-data-scientist

- ## üéØ open-source static site generator ‚Äî Observable Framework ‚Äî for creating fast, beautiful data apps _202402
- https://twitter.com/observablehq/status/1758167290942525738
- Did you give up on the "custom js" idea? 
- my dream is you making jupyter notebooks that don‚Äôt suck. My dream is seeing a python interpreter that works just like your current JS custom interpreter.
  - You should try writing Python data loaders in Framework! As soon as you save changes to your Python file, the page updates instantly with fresh data without you needing to reload.

- Maybe it worth a try to make a plugin for obsidian that can render the Observable notebook in the local environment. It would be a game changer for the note taking experience.

- ## it's too easy to get stuck in an infinite loop with autorun enabled. 
- https://twitter.com/zxch3n/status/1600659901080297472
  - if natto guesses you're writing a loop, it'll now automatically disable autorun.
- CodePen solved this by injecting custom code into loops if I remember correctly. The code will abort the loop if it takes too long to run
- yep! that's the most robust approach but i'd like to avoid injecting code if possible (1. needs to load parser before code can run. 2. changes runtime behavior)

- ## One great thing about using @observablehq is that I am not "locked in". 
- https://twitter.com/steren/status/1525226330039521280
  - notebooks can be exported in idiomatic JavaScript, and later loaded on my own website:

- ## To help investigate userspace bugs in long running @observablehq notebooks, I used @mootari 's access-runtime notebook to create a notebook state snapshot function. 
- https://twitter.com/tomlarkworthy/status/1508384106937303043
  - Now you get a readout of all the cells and their current state, and value is availible.

- ## Anyone seen any good patterns for running automated tests in an @observablehq notebook?
- https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1495094294851428352
- If ya looking for more end-to-end or integration tests: https://github.com/asg017/observable-prerender
  - Otherwise, abstracting your JS code into a separate package is always cool, or moving your data processing into a node script is also helpful

- ## Observable‚Äôs Not JavaScript_201906
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20184181
- I kinda want Observable to be it's own language that can compile to JS
  - And it kinda is. We provide a parser¬π and a runtime¬≤, and you can download a copy of any notebook compiled to a JavaScript module
  - That said, we‚Äôre explicitly designing for the reactivity of the notebook environment. 
- What's the rationale for results above code?
  - On Observable, each cell is a unit that can be evaluated independently, with two sides to it ‚Äî you have the source code editor, and you have the rendered display (either a chunk of DOM or canvas that you‚Äôve drawn, or an interactive inspector for JS values).
  - Now, the important thing is that the code half of the cell is often collapsed. 
  - If the code is on top, the entire cell jumps when it opens and closes, pushing the rendered display up and down. 
  - If the code is on the bottom, it emerges from the half of the cell that is always there, and the display is stable.
  - the rendered value as primary and the source code as secondary.
- Non-linear is a plus. Why force an order. Spreadsheet is non-linear and it works pretty well
- Clicking to reveal can be simply addressed with a global Expand-All toggle.
- What I'm talking about is editing code with Vim-like keys INSIDE the cells. An implementation of the Ace Editor or something similar would be amazing.
  - We use CodeMirror and are considering the vim bindings, but it‚Äôd probably be something we launch at the same time as user-configurable key bindings.
