- ## [N8n.io ‚Äì Workflow automation alternative to Zapier | Hacker News _201910](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21191676)
- Zapier has about 1, 000 integrations, more than any of their closest competitors and at a price that is far less than others in their space. 
  - What you've done here is great! The UX seems better than Zapier and the extensibility & community approach terrific. The key, though, is going to be adding integrations rapidly. 
- I might also stress: 
  - Bulk actions. 
  - Sync actions. 
  - And support for other programming languages (eg. python)

- I wonder why, in this era of Swagger / OpenAPI / Postman Collections / API Gateways ... why this is so difficult? I feel like there was a promise that integration would become more magical at a rapid clip, but as it stands it just seems like there are more options but no less headaches.
  - A lot of APIs don‚Äôt support the tooling you mentioned, have all sorts of rough edges (return improper http codes, or don't return them at all), or act...quirky at scale (based on my experience at an automation workflow org).

- Crowded space, but darn few (if any) shared source or community based solutions. Here's a several examples from a market study I did in 2018: Workato, Apiant, Inegromat, Snaplogic, CloudHQ, Boomi, Tibco, Jitterbit, AWS Lambda, Mulesoft, Tray.io, ApacheNiFi, Stringify, Adeptia, Kotive, Cazoomi, Scribesoft and several more.
  - I really think the community angle is unique.

- üÜöÔ∏è How is this different from node-red?
  - Loosely speaking Node-RED has a superset of the functionality this project has, sacrificing customization/generality for simplicity.
  - Zapier and n8n interface with the user via a catalog model.
  - Node-Red is more low-level. You can already see it in the way it describes itself "Flow-based programming for the Internet of Things". So it is "programming" what n8n does not try to be.
  - Other tools that can achieve similar results (using Directed Acyclic Graphs, where the nodes represent the execution of your code for a desired pre-programmed task) are Airflow, Flink, NiFi, Dagster, Dagobah, Celery, and many more.
