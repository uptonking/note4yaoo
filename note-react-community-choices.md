- No, maintenance on it has dropped off. A PR to update to new React context API has been open since September 2018. Maintainers have become unresponsive. Would avoid using react-intl for new projects.
  - There has been some renewed support recently. React context API and useIntl added in the v3 beta.
- seems not actively maintained anymore and has no native support for hooks
- react-i18next. Great ecosystem. Great docs. Easy to implement, flexible, good server side support.
