- TSDoc is a proposal to standardize the doc comments used in TypeScript code, so that different tools can extract content without getting confused by each other's markup. 

- ðŸ¤” Why can't JSDoc be the standard? 
  - The JSDoc grammar is not rigorously specified, but rather inferred from the behavior of a particular implementation. 
  - The majority of the standard JSDoc tags are preoccupied with providing type annotations for plain JavaScript, which is not a primary concern for a strongly-typed language such as TypeScript.

  - Write some typescript code and use the syntax required by tsdoc
  - Observe that hover documentation and highlighting completely ignore tsdoc and instead assume parity with jsdoc

- The TSDoc format states the following goals:
Design a grammar for TypeScript while extending JSDoc

Allow Markdown within comments

A common set of documentation tags

Extensible mechanism for adding tags

Interoperable, so custom tags wonâ€™t break parsing of non-custom tags and handling Markdown ambiguities

Cross-referencing between packages and dependencies

Open standard

- Additionally, the TSDoc reference parser also aims to provide:

Strict and lax modes, with lax attempting to parse existing JSDoc-based grammar

Bi-directional round-tripping between doc comments and abstract syntax trees

Self-contained, no dependency on the TypeScript compiler API, allowing the abstract syntax tree for comments to be a simple JavaScript object tree

- TypeScript developers should expect that JSDoc type annotations that are redundant with type information already provided > by TypeScript be optional with TSDoc.
