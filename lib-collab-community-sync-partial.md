- [What is Data Replication? Examples, Types, and Use Cases | Redis](https://redis.com/blog/what-is-data-replication/)
  - Full Database Replication occurs when an entire primary database is replicated within every replica instance available. 
  - partial replication only mirrors some parts of the data, typically recently updated data. Partial replication isolates particular bits of data following the importance of the data at a specific location.

- ## 🆚️ [Difference between Partial Replication and Sharding? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14136633/difference-between-partial-replication-and-sharding)
- Partial replication is an interesting way, in which you distribute the data with replication from a master to slaves, each contains a portion of the data. 
  - Eventually you get an array of smaller DBs, read only, each contains a portion of the data. 
  - Reads can very well be distributed and parallelized.
  - writes are still clogged, in 1 big fat lazy master database, tasks as buffer management, locking, thread locks/semaphores, and recovery tasks - are the real bottleneck of the OLTP, they make writes impossible to scale
- Sharding is where data appears only once, within an array of DBs. 
  - Each database is the complete owner of the data, data is read from there, data is written to there. 
  - This way, reads and writes are distributed and parallelized. Real scale-out can be achieved.
  - Sharding is a mess to handle, to maintain, it's hard as hell

- 💡 Sharding is a method of horizontal partitioning of a table. It doesn't related to replication. 
- Traditionally an RDBMS server located in the center of system with star like topology. That's why it becomes:
  - the single point of failure
  - the performance bottleneck of the system
- To resolve issue #1 you use replication: if original server dies you fail over to a replica.
- To resolve issue #2 you can:
  - use sharding: 1.1 do sharding by yourself; 1.2 use your RDBMS "out of the box" clustering mechanism
  - migrate to a NoSQL solution
- Sharding allows you to scale out database to many servers by splitting the data among them. However sharding is a trade-off. It limits you in data joining/intersecting/etc.
- You still have issue #1 if you use sharding. So it's a good practice to replicate sharded nodes.

- ## Friends from one big startup recently had to rewrite everything (and they are not finished yet) from SPA to SSR because their users have massive datasets that don’t fit into a browser. 
- https://twitter.com/evoluhq/status/1736087028087873947
  - They literally can’t leverage client JavaScript. React Server Components are an excellent fit for them.
  - Local-first for big companies makes sense only as some form of a client cache. Clients can’t store all data, only subsets. What @ElectricSQL does makes sense. Actually, it’s the only possible approach, I suppose.
  - Evolu chose a different path because it’s not for big companies' data but for individual personal data.

- ## One of the reasons React Server Components are inevitable, much like Thanos, is that UI is a function of data.
- https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1736074420635197924
  - In a CSR/SPA world, you must be willing to ship all of the code, for all of the possible data, before rendering can begin. This is why you see so many spinners.

- One thing I still don’t fully understand, is losing the benefit of an API that can be exposed to 3rd parties or used to build a mobile app down the road. Going back and doing this later can be challenging and costly. What’s the best way to handle with RSC?
  - An API for third-party consumption is a specific product you need to shape and treat as such. It shouldn’t be a side effect of your frontend application. In fact, you want to take advantage of your frontend fetching data in the most optimal way possible!

- ## [Partially synced patterns · WordPress/gutenberg_202305](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/50456)
- Today, when you insert a pattern, the blocks from that pattern are completely decoupled and standalone. There's no way to tell that those blocks originated from a pattern, especially since they can be edited to no longer resemble the source pattern.
  - Partially synced mode is different. When a pattern that's partially synced is inserted, it retains a reference to the source pattern. The blocks within the pattern are locked so that they cannot be removed or reordered and new blocks cannot be inserted (this is called contentOnly locking). Only specific parts of the pattern considered 'content' can be edited (denoted by adding __experimentalRole: 'content' to a block's definition).
  - When the source pattern is updated, all instances of blocks that reference the source pattern are updated too (much like a reusable block), but the content values the user entered are retained. The best way to think of this is that the user can update the design of a pattern, but doesn't lose content that exists in templates and posts.
- 👉🏻 The concept of partial syncing could be considered as similar to the way a handlebars, mustache, or other templating system works.
  - For partially synced patterns, I think it's also important that the data (the values of 'content' attributes) is kept separate from the template (the source pattern). This way, the data can be interpolated or injected into the pattern to produce the resulting HTML.

- ## [Priority Accumulator for partial and selective replication of entities · lifescapegame/bevy_replicon_202309](https://github.com/lifescapegame/bevy_replicon/issues/57)
- We decided to implement it as part of [Rooms · lifescapegame/bevy_replicon](https://github.com/lifescapegame/bevy_replicon/issues/15)
- 💡 The design we are considering assigns one room per entity. For this use-case you'd chunk the entities into rooms (as small as one or zero entities per room), then adjust which rooms each player is a member of.

- ## [ElectricSQL and PowerSync are both tackling the very hard problem of partial replication.  | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38492085)
- The idea is to build a general solution which allows a traditional centralized db to bidirectionally sync only what's needed on the client side - while still supporting optimistic mutations (and all the consistency/conflict stuff that goes along with that).

- ## [PowerSync - Show HN: Bi-directional sync between Postgres and SQLite | Hacker News_202311](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38473743)
- PowerSync Service handles the complexities of dynamic partial replication of the database to different users. In our announcement blog post we wrote a bit more about the trade-offs and design considerations
  - see section "A scalable dynamic partial replication system"

- ## [IndexedDB chunkstore · attic-labs/noms](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms/issues/2602)
- At the moment people use pouchdb and other things to enable offline first apps, but sync back to the server is less than stellar(杰出的) in terms of options, and couchbase is pretty tough to work with IMHO.
  - And lastly i can use gopherjs and bind to the JS NOM OR to the golang noms.
  - I guess you need to abstract a file system into a indexeddb, which is not a huge feat.

- ## [Syncable: possible collaboration · dexie/Dexie.js](https://github.com/dexie/Dexie.js/issues/397)
- What my library does is synchronize with the server every couple of minutes but the server is offline most of the time. 
  - I use a timestamp to know what to synchronize and the data update is done automatically, the user does not have to define how to do the update.
- Your use case seems similar to that of Dexie. Syncable - background sync that just happens when online without the user having to think about it. 
  - With Dexie. Syncable, the user is just using Dexie in the same way as if the addons weren't present but Dexie. Syncable will continuously keep the database in sync with the server bidirectionally.

- I want to implement partial data sending but I'm not sure I understood the concept correctly.
  - clientIdentity is essential for the server to be able to buffer uncommitted changes

- ## [Implementing Dexie. Syncable ISyncProtocol · dexie/Dexie.js](https://github.com/dexie/Dexie.js/issues/901)
- As what I recall partial changes are put in an intermediate table named "uncommittedChanges".
  - as I recall, the Dexie. Syncable framework should directly start another sync in case it was part partial so it continues to recieve data until partial is false. Then the framework should commit the uncommitted changes into the db.
- I did implement partial also for server -> client
  - Client sends the latest revision it got from the server. When using partial for server -> client, the server returns only a part of the array and the latest revision is the newest element in the partial array. Next time the client requests data with that revision, the changes are newly calculated. The server also tells the client that it was a partial data set so that the client can immediately request more data.

- ## [Partially synced patterns · WordPress/gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/50456)
- [The `wp:pattern` block](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48458)

- Partially synced mode is different. When a pattern that's partially synced is inserted, it retains a reference to the source pattern. The blocks within the pattern are locked so that they cannot be removed or reordered and new blocks cannot be inserted (this is called contentOnly locking).

- ## [[Sync] Allow for partial push · Nozbe/WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/206)
- Three ideas come to mind, from simplest to hardest:
- Just Sync Everything — like I suggested before. 
  - I think in most cases there's just no harm in this, and only benefits.
- Per-collection sync enable — currently ALL tables (except for magic localStorage table) are synced. 
  - I think a lot of apps might have a need for tables for local stuff (needing more complex stuff than LocalStorage provides), so it's reasonable to add a parameter to synchronize() to point to which tables to sync / skip syncing. 
  - This complicates your code, since you'd need to have two classes — one for synced orders, one for draft orders. 
  - But I think you could easily manage it with subclassing (AbstractOrder extends Model; Order extends AbstractOrder; DraftOrder extends AbstractOrder — the first would have most of the common logic, and the other two would just have stuff like publish() etc.)
- New sync status — currently there's created, updated, deleted (local changes waiting to be pushed) and synced (no local changes since pulled). 
  - There could also be draft. 
  - Your app would be responsible for managing such status — as this is much simpler on Watermelon's end and more versatile for apps with different needs. 
  - Needless to say, records would be recognized by client as changed if draft, but would not be pushed until changed to created. 
  - This seems doable, but further analysis is needed. And lots of tests if one was to implement it

- ## [Initial Sync Download · Nozbe/WatermelonDB](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/650)
- My first idea was to limit the sync size to a number of versions (or timestamps as per the default implementation) so it chunked the data. 
  - Once i tried this i quickly realised that i cannot guarantee how much data is between the 2 timestamps/versions as the data may or may not have been added to certain tables, therefore impossible to gauge.
  - So the core of the problem is that there is a risk of passing too much data between a server and a device, so i decided it would be better to calculate the size of the data between 2 versions and store this in a table. version_from	version_to	size

- ## [vlcn: Partial CRR Sync](https://vlcn.io/docs/networking/partial-crr-sync)
- While it is possible to implement partial sync with the primitives available to you today, it is not advised and not supported. 
  - In Q3/Q4 2023 we will be releasing primitives specifically intended to support partial sync, row level security, and large scale multi-tenant databases.

- ## [Launch HN: PeerDB (YC S23) – Fast, Native ETL/ELT for Postgres | Hacker News_202307](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36895220)
- For the past 8 years, working at Microsoft on Postgres on Azure, and before that at Citus Data, I’ve worked closely with customers running Postgres at the heart of their data stack
  - why not build a tool specialized for Postgres, making the lives of many Postgres users easier
  - We started with two main use cases: Real-time Change Data Capture from Postgres and Real-time Streaming of query results from Postgres
  - For CDC, we don’t use Debezium, rather handle replication more natively—reading the slot, replicating the changes, keeping state etc. We made this choice mainly for flexibility
  - For usability - we provide a Postgres compatible SQL layer for data-movement
  - 👉🏻 The types of data replication supported include CDC streaming replication and query-based batch replication. Workers do all of the heavy lifting, and have data store specific optimizations.
- PeerDB replicate any DML (insert/update/delete) efficiently to the target data-store (incl BigQuery).

- 🤔 Does PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL streaming using PeerDB have any benefit over just using Streaming Replication?
  - Postgres Streaming replication is very robust and has been in Postgres since multiple 10s of years. Logical replication/decoding (that PeerDB uses) is more recent - introduced in the last decade. 
  - However 👉🏻 streaming replication is harder to manage/setup and a bit restrictive - most cloud providers don't give access to WAL, so you cannot use streaming replication to replicate data across cloud providers.
  - Sure you can use PeerDB for backing up data - using CDC based replication or query based replication and both of these are pretty fast with PeerDB. You can have cold backups (store data to s3, blob etc) or hot backups (another postgres database). However note that the replication is async and there is some lag (few 10s of seconds) on the target data-store. So if you are expecting 0 data-loss, this won't be the right approach for backups/HA. 
  - With streaming replication, replication can be synchronous (synchronous_commit setting), which helps with 0 data-loss.

- PeerDB should work or Aurora PostgreSQL. It should work for both log based (CDC) and query based replication. Log based because Aurora supports pgoutput plugin. Curious, are you leveraging CDC to move data to S3? or more query (batch) based?

- Can this be used with Citus or Hydra?
  - Both should be supported as target data-stores.
  - As a source, PeerDB should likely work with any Postgres based databases (like Citus). Query based replication should work! Log based (CDC) replication could have a few quirks - i.e. the source database should support "pgoutput" format for change data capture. 
  - As we evolve we do planning to enable a native data-movement experience for Postgres based (both extensions and postgres-compatible) databases!

- ## [Notes on CouchDB architecture | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/residentmario/notes-on-couchdb-architecture)
- CouchDB maintains sequence numbers for the purposes of replication. The sequence number is a tracker of state equivalence, less failures. Replication failures, when they occur, are simply logged. A replication is not considered complete until the keys that still need to be replicated are carried over. 
  - All of this also means, by the way, that partial replication is possible, and that you can have a database in an indeterminate intermediate state. So replications are not atomic. Fun times!

- ## 🤔 [Does CouchDB really keep a whole replication of the database on the client-side too? : CouchDB_202211](https://www.reddit.com/r/CouchDB/comments/yr7w3u/does_couchdb_really_keep_a_whole_replication_of/)
- So you can do this kind of partial replication using filters (it's discussed with PouchDB here: https://pouchdb.com/api.html#filtered-replication ). The only real caveat to it is that deletes need to be handled either by the filter (always pass through _deleted entries) or by not wiping the fields used for the filter when deleting.
  - There's not much in the way of what I'd call "cached" replication built in. Where you'd address a single interface that then checks local+remote and does the sync for you in the background to just keep what you need locally. Or cache eviction (e.g. purge documents locally only, that aren't needed). Those are more exercises for the reader/app developer.

- [1.1. Technical Overview — Apache CouchDB® 3.3 Documentation](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/intro/overview.html)
  - Partial replicas can be created and maintained. Replication can be filtered by a JavaScript function, so that only particular documents or those meeting specific criteria are replicated. This can allow users to take subsets of a large shared database application offline for their own use, while maintaining normal interaction with the application and that subset of data.

- ## 🤔 [I created PouchDB. After a year... | Hacker News_202009](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24355263)
- I created PouchDB. After a year or so I handed that project off to some great maintainers that made it much better as I had grown a little skeptical of the replication model and wanted to pursue some alternatives.
- It’s been about 10 years, much longer than I thought it would take, but I have a young project that finally realizes the ideas I had back then.
- 👉🏻 **Sometime after PouchDB was created I realized that it just wasn’t going to work to replicate a whole database to every client**. 
  - In fact, even a view of the database wasn’t going to work, because the developer isn’t in a position to really understand the replication profile of every user on all of their devices, you need a model that has partial, or more accurately “selective” replication based on what the application accesses in real time.
- I became convinced that the right primitives were already present in git: merkle trees. Unfortunately, git did a very poor job of surfacing those primitives for general use and I wasn’t having much luck finding the right approach myself.
- Shortly after joining Protocol Labs I realized they had already figured this out in a project called IPLD. Not long after that, I started leading the IPLD project/team and then putting together my ideal database whenever I found a free moment.
- It’s very young, lots of missing features, still working on some better data-structures for indexing, but **it is very much a database that replicates the way git does and approaches indexing over a primary store the way CouchDB does, but there’s a lot more too**.
- With these primitives we can easily **nest databases inside of other databases** (and create unified indexes over them) and we can easily extend the data types in the database to user provided types. Using some of these features it already supports streams of binary data, databases in databases, and linking between pieces of data.

- ## [PouchDB, the JavaScript Database That Syncs | Hacker News_201612](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13101870)
- PouchDB's replication capability is interesting, but is there a way to make it lazy load to the local DB instead of doing everything up front? I hesitate to use it for a web project with 10+ MB of docs where it would otherwise be ideal.
- You can provide a **server-side filter function** to replication and progressively filter partial replications until eventually everything gets replicated. At that point it becomes a question of architecture of your documents: how much is needed to replicate before a user may be productive?
  - You can also explore **pouchdb-replication-stream** to build bundles that PouchDB can bootstrap from a little bit faster than a chatty replication.
  - That said, I've found initial replications of large databases (one I've worked with this week is a 25+ MB CouchDB database full of photos) is quick enough (and mostly bandwidth constrained) that I haven't had much in the way of concern over it.

  - As I understand I can achieve this passing query_selector to replicate method, but the question is, will it resync items with sequence_number lower then last sync? I mean will it sync oldest messages after newer message was synced?

- You can use filtered replication

- ## [Best practices for syncing large data sets_202103](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/best-practices-for-syncing-large-data-sets/99658)
- I think our usecase is a good candidate for query-based sync, but unfortunately, that’s not quite ready. In the meantime, is there a workaround that will allow us to get all the benefits of sync while deciding which collections we want to remain on the device?
- If some of the data does not need to be synced why wouldn’t you configure the read rules partitions that way that uneeded data will not be synced?
  - My thoughts is that data that is not produced by the device will need to be accessed via internet… Does that works?

- ## [Everything You Know About MongoDB Is Wrong | Hacker News_202011](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25216530)
- The mongo I'm dealing with now scales by database. Each entity has between 20-100GB of data in its own database; we're adding entities continually. If I try to replicate for performance, I'll be replicating everything--there's no selective replication. If I shard, I'll be sharding within a collection, which is the equivalent of striped RAID--great if that's what you need. I don't. I need to shard at the database layer. I need my queries routed according to the database at which they're aimed, not by the sharding key. Can I? Not a chance in hell with any of the existing scaling mechanisms from Mongo. My current mongo VM is already the largest Azure offers. How do I add more RAM to that?

- MongoDB Realm currently(202006) only supports full sync.
  - The team is considering how to architect more flexible sync options in future, but there isn’t a specific timeline for this yet

- We are still(202103) a long way away from launching query-based sync 2.0 with a more flexible syncing API. 
  - My suggestion would be to **use partition-based sync** and not wait as we will not have QBS production ready before the legacy realm cloud shuts down.
