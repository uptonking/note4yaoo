- ## [Why is pgAdmin such trash? : PostgreSQL _202303](https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/11g1a0l/why_is_pgadmin_such_trash/)
- No, it's not an official GUI.
  - The only "official" SQL client for Postgres is `psql`




- I just found this thread after searching 'pgAdmin is horrible'. Coming from an Oracle and and MySql background its pretty bad that they throw you in front of pgAdmin. If you're a beginner its the interface they give you however at the top, however it does not allow you actually browse or search for objects but yet at the same time will allow you mess up the database.
