  - TL; DR: Design systems + CSS Zen Garden = Awesome.
  - Each component in a design system contains its own structure, style, and behavior.
  - In my own design system work, I’ve found there’s often a finite number of ways to structure a component (with HTML) and make it interactive (with JavaScript), but the styling possibilities are seemingly endless.
  - we can create systems that allow for a lot of aesthetic flexibility while still retaining a shared underlying structural foundation.
  - So how do we actually go about creating design systems that can serve wildly different brands, audiences, and contexts?
  - From Salesforce’s Lightning Design System, which popularized the term “design tokens” in design systems
  - Design tokens move variables to a higher level, making it easier to manage brand attributes without diving deep into a codebase
  - First tier variables define the brand’s core attributes, serving as the raw materials for the UI’s visual design
  - The second tier takes the first-tier variables and starts applying them to high-level applications within the UI.
  - The third tier is component-specific variables, which are found in each component’s partial. 
  - We can now map the high-level application variables to specific components.
  - Atomic design is a methodology for creating thoughtful UI design systems: all of the vastness and complexity of our UI universe can be broken down into a finite set of atomic elements. 
  - Components are included inside of more complex components, which are in turn included inside even more complex components. 
  - This Russian-nesting-dolls approach to UI design systems helps teams thoughtfully create the whole experience and the parts of the whole at the same time.
  - Using the variable system described above, we can define the button atom‘s visual styles for 5 unique brands.
  - A molecule is a component made up of a handful of atoms. A card molecule is a common component that can house all sorts of different content.
  - An organism is a complex component that’s made up of atoms, molecules, or other organisms.

  - interfaces are made up of components that can be categorized into building blocks
