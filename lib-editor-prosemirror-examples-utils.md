- amat-react /1Star/MIT/202207/js/提交多
  - https://github.com/APMG/amat-react

- https://bitbucket.org/jstleger/prosemirror-composer
  - A useful way to keep complex prosemirror projects tidy, maintainable and testable.
  - complex Prosemirror project: [how we structured our code](https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/prosemirror-composer-wip/3887)
  - Modifier - A modifier function takes a `transaction` and returns a `transaction`.
  - Handler - A handler function takes the `editorView` and composes the modifier functions and `dispatches` them.

- https://github.com/atlassian/prosemirror-utils
  - Utils library for ProseMirror

- https://github.com/rexxars/react-prosemirror-document
  - Render a ProseMirror document in JSON-format using React
  - 不使用prosemirror-view，直接转换PMNode然后用react渲染文档，实现过于简单

- https://github.com/sueddeutsche/prosemirror-recreate-transform
  - This module allows recreating the steps needed to go from document A to B
  - it allows merging two different Transforms (sets of steps) whose steps may be conflicting.
  - Recreating steps can be interesting for example in order to show the changes between two document versions without having access to the original steps.

- https://github.com/ryaninvents/prosemirror-doc-tpl
  - jsx转PMNode，代码量很少

- https://github.com/OrkhanAlikhanov/prosemirror-replaceattrs
  - The missing ReplaceAttrsStep for prosemirror
  - In prosemirror, in order to update attributes of a node, you must delete it and replace with a new node with updated attributes.
  - While this works perfectly, during collaboration it does not go well with undo history. 

- https://github.com/hamflx/prosemirror-diff /202207
  - 支持保留新版本状态的标记
- https://github.com/pubpub/prosemirror-diff
  - /201907

- https://github.com/davvidbaker/prosemirror-position-debugger
