- [Extension Capabilities Overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/overview)
  - VSCode offers many ways for extensions to extend its capabilities. It can sometimes be hard to find the right Contribution Points and VS Code API to use. 
  - [Contribution Points](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points)
  - [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api)
- [Custom Editor API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/custom-editors)
  - There are two parts to a custom editor: the view that users interact with and the document model that your extension uses to interact with the underlying resource.
  - The view side of a custom editor is implemented using a **webview**
  - Webviews cannot access the VS Code API directly but they can talk with extensions by passing messages back and forth.
  - The other part of a custom editor is the **document model**.
  - A CustomTextEditorProvider uses VS Code's standard TextDocument as its document model and all changes to the file are expressed using VS Code's standard text editing APIs.
  - A CustomTextEditorProvider uses VS Code's standard TextDocument as its document model and all changes to the file are expressed using VS Code's standard text editing APIs, for example split-view
  - There are two classes of custom editors: custom text editors and custom editors. 
  - `CustomTextEditor` are considerably easier to implement because VS Code already knows how to work with text files 
  - you can use a `CustomEditor` for binary formats such as images, but it also means that your extension is responsible for a lot more, including implementing save and backing.
