  - cocalc

- examples
  - 官方示例要点 server
    - droppable - collision detection algorithm 切换内置的冲突检测算法
    - restrict to window edges 限制被拖拽元素在容器内
    - snap to grid 可让被拖拽元素沿着网格格子移动
    - snap center to cursor 让元素中心先移动到鼠标，再拖拽
    - render before sorting
    - transformed container
    - pages layout 提供了指示线示例

  - 💡 效果参考、rewrite改进
  - [树形控件 Tree - Ant Design，拖拽时显示指示线](https://ant.design/components/tree-cn)
    - 拖拽父级节点时，所有子级会先折叠
    - 任一节点可水平拖动改变父子层级，指示线位置在预期位置而不是左右
  - [draggable - rc-tree](https://tree-react-component.vercel.app/demo/draggable)
    - 拖拽父级菜单时，所有元素会先维持布局不变，拖拽结束时才更新布局
  - https://frontend-collective.github.io/react-sortable-tree
    - 不支持显示拖拽指示线
    - 每一行容器都是`position: absolute`，默认 `display: block` 布局
    - 从左到右依次是，折叠按钮+横线 > 父级连接线(竖线+横线，通过::before/::after实现) > nodeContent

- alternatives
  - use-gesture(vanillajs)
  - react-dnd

- 拖拽功能的调试方法
  - 👉🏻 使用浏览器devtools，对类似mouseup/keyDown的事件打断点，或在代码中debugger
  - 👉🏻 使用键盘实现拖拽，很容易调试拖拽中的状态

- tips
  - 左右拖拽时，要区分水平移动和创建分栏，一般只在顶层创建分栏
  - 向左拖拽子级节点时，被拖拽节点会自动提升到父节点的下一个节点，符合预期，参考文件拖拽
# roadmap
- 📡 [future of library & maintenance_20230829](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/1194)
  - I want to reassure everyone that I'm still actively working on this library. 
  - The reason why a lot of issues have gone unaddressed for a while is that I have been working on a significant refactor of @dnd-kit since earlier this year.
  - Framework agnostic by building an agnostic layer that can be extended by concrete implementations, such as a DOM layer.
  - Keep most of the same core concepts, such as sensors, collision detection algorithms, and modifiers, but make the library easier to learn and adopt.
  - Making the core library extensible via a plugin system.
  - More granularity: Each draggable can have its own sensors and modifiers, and each droppable can have its own collision detection algorithm.
  - Performance improvements: reducing unnecessary re-renders being very high on the list
  - I am hoping to launch the refactor with React and Vanilla as the main two targets, and lots of APIs are still in flux, so it's a bit early to involve others in this refactor.
  - I will be looking for developers who have experience working in other frameworks such as Vue, SolidJS, Svelte, etc. to adapt @dnd-kit to work with those frameworks and maintain those compatibility layers. 
- 👷 202602: agnostic libs are released - @dnd-kit/state@0.3.0, @dnd-kit/react@0.3.0

## not-yet

- not-yet
  - DragOverlay内为什么不要使用useDraggable/useSortable
  - 如何接收外部(非DndContext内)的dnd事件
  - resize
  - performance: rerender
  - collision

- [dnd-kit/core@6.0.0+: infinity loop when using with variadic-width approach](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/842)

- [Is there any way to force a droppable to accept draggables that come from outside its parent DndContext?](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/discussions/181)
  - [Difficult to manage drags across sections of the app](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/58)
  - This should be a lot easier to manage with the introduction of the `useDndMonitor` hook along with the fact that data defined in `useDraggable` and `useDroppable` is now exposed on the `active` and `over` properties.

- [Proposal: add a SensorOptions property to facilitate disabling drag on interactive elements](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/863)
  - Here is the list of interactive elements that we block dragging from by default
  - input, textarea, select, option, button, contenteditable

- [Framer Motion for layout animation](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/605)
  - [Handling differently sized grid draggable items](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/720)
  - dnd-kit doesn't currently have built-in sorting strategies that handle unpredictable layouts. You could try building one yourself, but that's a lot of work.
  - The general recommended strategy in these scenarios is to update the order of the items `onDragOver` and pass in a sorting strategy that returns null (`<SortableContext strategy={() => null}>`)

- [Sortable CSS transform bug on items with various width](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/issues/737)
  - None of the built-in sorting strategies of @dnd-kit/sortable support unpredictable layouts.
  - The recommended approach in that situation is to move the items onDragOver instead of onDragEnd and passing a sorting strategy that returns nothing to SortableContext

# codebase

## tree

- 通过KeyboardSensor来计算drop位置

## useDraggable

```JS
// isDragging只做简单比较
const isDragging = active?.id === id;
```

## useSortable

```JS
// isSorting简单检查useDraggable的返回值
const isSorting = Boolean(active);
```

## DragOverlay

- 默认布局 `position:fixed`

## DndContext

```JS
const overId = getFirstCollision(collisions, 'id');

// Fires anytime as the draggable item is moved.
export interface DragMoveEvent extends DragEvent {}

// Fires when a draggable item is moved over a droppable container
export interface DragOverEvent extends DragMoveEvent {}
```

## keyboard

- The keyboard activator is the `onKeyDown` event handler. 
  - By default, the keys that activate the Keyboard sensor are `Space` and `Enter`.

## collision

```typescript
/ ** id + data, candidate node for drop * /
export interface Collision {
  id: UniqueIdentifier;
  data?: Record<string, any>;
}

const collisionRect = draggingNodeRect; // modified

const collisions = collisionDetection({
  active,
  collisionRect,
  droppableRects,
  droppableContainers: enabledDroppableContainers,
  pointerCoordinates,
});

const overId = getFirstCollision(collisions, 'id');
```

# changelog

## [v6.0.0_202205](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/releases/tag/%40dnd-kit%2Fcore%406.0.0)

- Accessibility-related props have been regrouped under the `accessibility` prop of `<DndContext>`.
- The DOM nodes for the screen reader instructions and announcements are no longer portaled into the document.body element by default.
- The drop animation now ensures that the the draggable node that we are animating to is in the viewport before performing the drop animation and scrolls it into view if needed.

- @dnd-kit/sortable@7.0.0
  - The UniqueIdentifier type has been updated to now accept either string or number identifiers. 
    - As a result, the id property of useDraggable, useDroppable and useSortable and the items prop of `<SortableContext>` now all accept either string or number identifiers.
  - Better handling of overlapping droppable
  - Introducing the concept of activator node refs for useDraggable and useSortable. 
    - This allows @dnd-kit to handle common use-cases such as restoring focus on the activator node after dragging via the keyboard or only allowing the activator node to instantiate the keyboard sensor.
  - Focus management is now automatically handled by @dnd-kit.
