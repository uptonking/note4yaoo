  - The catalyst for the paper was this 2021 HackerNews post about somebody wondering why people use relational databases instead of graph databases: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28736405

- Cool. But the Graph db take is so-so: you cited DuckPGQ, but they compared their system to the problematic Neo4j. And there is a claim there that graph algorithms cannot scale. You mention TigerGraph in your paper, but there is no comparison, while TG is really good on MPP cases
