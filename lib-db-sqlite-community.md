- ## imagine there was a sqlite extension for making KV virtual tables. What features would you expect? 
- https://twitter.com/agarcia_me/status/1690474942285103104
  - ttl/expiry for entries? Multiple keys? Keys besides strings? Subscriptions?

- aren't you describing redis. Basically any feature of redis say yeah sure all the way until you have a pub sub model with channels.

- I‚Äôd model it after Redis - both relative TTLs and absolute Unix seconds. 
  - But with SQL, you could also potentially query all (e.g) ‚Äúkeys expiring in the next 5 minutes‚Äù + similar table-wide ops that Redis can‚Äôt.

- We used to build relational databases on top of kv stores e.g. MySQL using BerkeleyDB and some engines let you specify you want non-key values stored in the index so you don't need to read other files eg Postgres exposing this layer of sqlite could be cool to make smaller files

- why this need ‚Äúextension‚Äù?????
  - How do you guarantee that this cache will stay within a certain memory limit? Redis can guarantee it.
  - SQLite can already provide database level heap limits so with some hacking that could plausibly be extended for a use case like this, I think.
- I'm thinking of table-level size-on-disk or row count limits. Like "make a new KV table that's a max 50MB" or "this KV table has a max 5K rows" or something. enforced with virtual table logic on INSERT/UPDATEs
  - For notions cache we have a row count limit, but need to carefully schedule our delete & LRU time stamp update transactions for low read & update IO times to avoid degrading app performance
- SQLite doesn‚Äôt have this kind of hard limit. You can limit max pages, but you‚Äôll need at most 2x the page limit of the DB to VACUUM, and WAL things may go over too
- Yup, mostly to enforce the ttl so you don't have to do it manually. Otherwise `CREATE TABLE kv (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value ANY)` is just fine

- ## I used to think forking sqlite (e.g., @libsqlhq ) was crazy but I'm on board now. 
- https://twitter.com/tantaman/status/1684917032096030722
  - While SQLite is great, I just don't think it is ready for the demands of the coming years.
- What do you mean specifically? The weak update hook?
  1. weak update hook / subscriptions 
  2. lack of write concurrency 
  3. lack of pluggable storage engines (eg custom btree rather than vfs or vtab)
  4. limited types
  5. lack of tiered storage
  - Now abandoned SQLite 4 had fixed 3, SQLite hc-tree might fix 2

- Agree about update hook. BEGIN CONCURRENT is not enough write concurrency? I guess not if you want update hook anyway I wonder how long until libsql has a rocksdb backend
- Notion is using SQLite on mobile, correct? How do you guys deal with reacting to mutations?
  - `sqlite3_update_hook` works for us

- Yeah let‚Äôs do it and add cell-level reactivity while we are at it.

- ## Nobody is feasibly going to rewrite Sqlite in Rust.
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25464846
  - Is making √† file based database that hard, compared to creating new programming language for example ?

- If you gave me two year I'm not sure I could implement a filesystem API that correctly did something as simple as "atomically append to a file". See also Dan Luu's writing on the topic of filesystems

- The problem is to write a reliable file database. 
  - Firefox got a lot of bugs related to history file corruption until it was replaced with SQLite. 
  - The same story was with Subversion where they replaced Berkeley key DB due to reliability issues.
  - This reliability comes from a very deep knowledge of OS API and all their corner cases. 
  - Creating a programming language typically involves less corner cases and the bugs in the compiler/runtime are much simple to reproduce (again, typically).

- ## [Xlite: Query Excel and Open Document spreadsheets as SQLite virtual tables | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31874767)
- Sqlite does not allow table valued functions to return results with varying schemas. The schema must be defined once up front and then cannot change.
  - That forum post is a request I made to them to allow dynamic columns but they don't seem interested so far.

- ## Introducing sqlite-xsv - a SQLite extension for quickly querying CSVs!
- https://twitter.com/agarcia_me/status/1613688022079508480
  - Custom delimiters, quotes, column names and types
  - written in Rust, with sqlite-loadable!
- For *non-analytical* queries, I have found sqlite-xsv to be:
  - 1.5-2x faster than other CSV SQLite extensions
  - 1.2-3x faster than @DuckDB, DataFusion, clickhouse-local (!!)
  - 6x faster than pandas
  - 14x faster than sqlite3's .import
  - ~300x faster than dsq, sqlite-utils
- For *analytical* queries 
  - directly on CSVs (ex GROUP BYs and ORDER BYs), both sqlite-xsv and sqlite in general fall short compared to new-age tools like @DuckDB , DataFusion, and clickhouse.

- ## [ What is the SQLite of nosql databases? | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27490361)
- As others have mentioned you have lots of options: LMDB, LevelDB/RocksDB, BerkeleyDB. 
  - For what it's worth, I spent a long time looking for an embedded key-value store for my current native project since I didn't need the full complexity of SQL. In the end I chose... SQLite.
  - All of these embedded NoSQL databases seem to be missing critical features. 
  - One such feature for my use case is database compaction. 
  - Last I checked, an LMDB database file can never shrink. 
  - Full compaction of LevelDB is slow and complicated (as I understand it essentially breaks the levels optimization which is the whole point of the thing.) 
  - SQLite meanwhile supports fast incremental vacuum(Ê∏ÖÊ¥ÅÔºõÁúüÁ©∫), and it can be triggered manually or automatically.
  - SQLite just has everything. Plus the reliability is unmatched. 
  - Even if you just need a single table that maps blob keys to blob values, I would still recommend SQLite over any NoSQL database today.

- The SQLite of NoSQL is still SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html

- Filesystem. Linux has VFS cache which is very robust and efficient.
  - Remember that it is typical for programs to read /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/resolve.conf and tons of others at startup time - the filesystem is the datasource in Unix tradition, so the machinery is very well optimized.
- SQLite has a backend which is well suited as a key-value store.
  - Here is a NoSql database based on the SQLite backend
  - https://github.com/symisc/unqlite /202205/clang
    - UnQLite is an embedded NoSQL (Key/Value store and Document-store) database engine.

- ## Is there a good way to use SQLite with serverless?
- https://twitter.com/makon_dev/status/1630635156716306443
- Depends on what you mean by "serverless." üòÖ @flydotio could be called serverless in the sense that you don't have to manage servers. In any case, to use SQLite you need a persistent volume, or you could use a service like @ChiselStrike :)
- Chiselstrike is SQLite over WASM with HTTP client (so you don‚Äôt need a TCP pipe or access to process aka Node; works in edge /serverless/workers)
  - LolaDB is an HTTP client that pulls all your db clients on a centralized server infra & wraps the calls into a unified interface 
  - Prisma Data Proxy gives you a prisma:// protocol connection. Should work on serverless HTTP as well ‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt tested it

- ## [sqlite rowid after deleting rows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35876171)
  - I delete rows with id 3 and 4 and run above query again.
  - Now my problem is rowid not getting reset and holes.
  - Âú®Âà†Èô§Êüê‰∫õË°åÂêéÔºåÂÖ∂‰ªñÊâÄÊúâË°åÁöÑrowid‰∏çÂèòÔºå‰∏çÂèóÂΩ±ÂìçÔºåÂ∞±‰ºöÂΩ¢ÊàêÊñ≠Êñ≠Áª≠Áª≠ÁöÑrowid
- rowid is really special. So special that if you have an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` , it becomes an alias for the rowid column. 
  - when your primary key is an alias for rowid, it would be terribly inconvenient if this could change. 
  - Since rowid is now aliased to your application data, it would not be acceptable for sqlite to change it.
- If you really really really absolutely need the rowid to change on a VACUUM, you can avoid this aliasing behavior. Note that it will decrease the performance of any table lookups using your primary key.
  - To avoid the aliasing, and degrade your performance, you can use `INT` instead of `INTEGER` when defining your key

## [Why Is SQLite Coded in C (2017) | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28278859)

- But it's still a database, a low level, high performance software system. 
  - Even if you write it in rust, some percentage of the code will be unsafe rust or rust that calls a library written in C. 
  - It will be safer, but still not a panacea. 
  - It would be more viable in my opinion to improve the safety of the C code that currently makes up sqlite.
