- ## ðŸ¤” What database has the best query language thatâ€™s not sql?
- https://twitter.com/aboodman/status/1607790827996327936
- tinybase > tinyQL
- I think graphQL occupies a pretty useful and pragmatic niche.
  - SQL suffers from cartesianification. Results are a square tabular matrix, which does not effeciently express heirarchical data. Probably graphQL tree shaped results actually fits app data better.
- iâ€™m biased (due to previous employment), but definitely think neo4j and cypher is the answer youâ€™re looking for!  ASCII art ftw!  
- Vertipaq with DAX language
- #datomic's #datalog is very intuitive if all you need are inner joins, which is just unification of variables. The minute you need anything else, things get ugly. Uglier than SQL? Who knows, pick your poison.
- Kusto Query Language (KQL), used by Azure Data Explorer and other Azure products. I'm a skeptic when it comes to query languages and DSLs and yet... KQL is awesome IMO
- Malloy fixes my vote for SQLs biggest flaw â€” combining entity relationships with querying. Malloy separates them, which is genius, especially for ML
- EdgeDB is an open-source database designed as a spiritual successor to SQL and the relational paradigm
- My biggest gripe with SQL is the lack of composability. When writing complex code, I can easily pull out functions. When complex writing SQL, I end up with a giant unmaintainable blob. I hope whatever solution you find addresses this!
- @perplexity_ai â€˜s birdsql. Query in natural language (English), GPT figures out the sql. Hot take: natural language is the best query language.
