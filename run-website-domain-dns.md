- ## Would you prefer a subdomain or sub-folder for your customer pages?

  - I chose to go with subdomain (http://example.earlybird.im) instead of subfolder (http://earlybird.im/example), but I noticed that some of my competitors are using subfolders. Am I doing it wrong?
- Cost related can you fund a wildcard SSL cert for the sub domains, or automate letsencrypt? Sub folder would be cheaper to secure and no need to catch all on the DNS.
- For SEO purposes. subfolder works better.
- The subdomain is fine, sub-folder should all be SEO-related contents.
