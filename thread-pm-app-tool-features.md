- ## 为了让我的个人网站 100 年后依然可用
- https://twitter.com/ThaddeusJiang/status/1522476166703362048
1. 使用 @TiddlyWiki 构建，真正零依赖，只有一个 HTML。
2. #OSS in GitHub，同时部署在 GitHub Pages 和 @Netlify 。
3. 使用 #互联网档案馆 备份，并且为其捐款。

- ## 推荐一个可以一键生成随机用户头像和名称的工具Random Users，
- http://xsgames.co/randomusers/
  - 网站上提供了一些参数可以选择，比如性别（男性或女性），头像风格可以是彩色、黑白或像素类型，头像形状支持圆形和方形，网站底部给出了对应的API可以直接使用。

- ## Handshake is our(Framer) new game-changing beta feature, enabling anyone to import components into production with just a URL.

- ## @algolia docsearch can now index your technical blog, for free
- https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1443920402686922755
  - I believe now a Docusaurus-based tech blog would be eligible

- ## Tiny helpers
- https://tiny-helpers.dev/
  - A collection of free single-purpose online tools for web developers

- ## CODECHECK
- https://codecheck.org.uk/
- CODECHECK tackles one of the main challenges of computational research by supporting codecheckers with a workflow, guidelines and tools to evaluate computer programs underlying scientific papers. 
- The independent time-stamped runs conducted by codecheckers will award a “certificate of executable computation” and increase availability, discovery and reproducibility of crucial artefacts for computational sciences.

- ## Figma really is a much better tool for basic vector image editing than Inkscape. 
- https://twitter.com/stevage1/status/1417354508464574465
  - Upload some SVGs, easily export to PNG. And keep them organised however you want.
- also the ceo of figma write esbuild in his spare time
- And you can share workspaces

- ## natto.dev is a canvas for JavaScript.
- https://www.notion.so/Documentation-44fea11f393a4e46b5a22f5799de58ca
  - creates an eval pane which consists of an expression editor and output. 
  - This is very much like a JavaScript console. 

- ## Cloudflare Pages is now in GA! 
- https://twitter.com/Cloudflare/status/1381593197311315973
  - It's hard to believe how much the product has matured in just a few months.
  - Dogfooding through and through, on Workers, SSL for SaaS, and on top of Cloudflare's network allows us to go FAST
- Awesome! I love the addition of custom redirects with the _redirects file. Looking forward to being able to add workers to an /api directory within the same page too! 
- This is great! Any chance we might get to use the same tooling to deploy workers without a path prefix for a fully dynamic edge rendered site? 
- I get the idea from this post that Polish and Mirage are included for free as part of pages - is this correct? If so, amazing

- ## I'm excited to share a preview of natto.dev, a canvas for writing and manipulating JavaScript.
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1370402539720503298
  - It's kinda like a JS playground, script runner, API client, JSON viewer, datavis tool, .. not sure exactly but it feels like something!
- nice! dragging a column out of a table is awesome. I also like the design of the wires, ambiently visible but light enough to not feel too "in the way"
  - I could imagine a non-programmer playing with this, and gradually picking up JS by messing w the code snippets
- each pane is an expression but you could fit arbitrary long content in a single expression.
  - it's kinda like a Swift playground but you choose where the logpoints are.
