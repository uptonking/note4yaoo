# thread-pm-documentation-note-taking

# pieces

- ## 

- ## Try the omakase layout on http://natto.dev! 
- https://twitter.com/_paulshen/status/1388211716001910786
  - Panes rearrange as you move your focus. 
  - Connected panes are shown to the side (inputs on left, outputs on right)
- if there's too much motion, turn on "reduce motion" in your accessibility settings
- I am pretty excited about dynamically showing related content in tools. eg showing incoming/outgoing calls when you're focused on a function in your editor
  - seems like a natural feature
