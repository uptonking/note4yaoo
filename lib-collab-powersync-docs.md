## üîÄ [Handling Update Conflicts | PowerSync Docs](https://docs.powersync.com/usage/lifecycle-maintenance/handling-update-conflicts)

- What happens when two users update the same records while offline?
  - The default behavior is essentially ‚Äúlast write wins‚Äù, but this can be customized by the developer.
  - It is up to your app backend to implement these operations and associated conflict handling.

- CRDT data structures such as Yjs can be stored and synced using PowerSync, allowing you to build collaborative apps that merge users' updates automatically. 
  - Built-in support for CRDT operations in PowerSync may also be added in the future.
