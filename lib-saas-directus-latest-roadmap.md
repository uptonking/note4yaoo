  - First release of the new SDK 
  - Add support for Supabase Storage for files

- v10.4.0_20230628
  - Dropped support for Memcached
    - Directus used to support either memory, Redis, or Memcached for caching and rate-limiting storage. 
    - Since the 10.3 release, Redis has been used more integrated as part of WebSockets/Subscriptions 
    - we've decided to sunset Memcached in favor of focussing on Redis as the primary solution for pub/sub and hot-storage across load-balanced Directus installations.

    - We've been working hard on redesigning the SDK from the ground up

  - Added support for building API extensions to ESM format and default to ESM for new extensions

  - We weren‚Äôt in it for the ‚Äúquick buck.‚Äù We wanted to build a premium product, without technical debt, that would stand the test of time
  - The answer was to take our time distilling all the specific features and requirements we‚Äôd seen over decades of building one-off projects, abstracting everything into an agnostic solution.
  - we focused on making Directus a collaborative project, embracing new engineers from around the world, all joining us as contributors to our open source project.
