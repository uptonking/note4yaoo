- ## Do you know what persistence is like in Chrome?

  - Say my website dumps 1 GB of data in an OPFS SQLite database. Does that get persisted similar to IndexedDB? Like will it get evicted(È©±ÈÄêÔºåËµ∂Âá∫) due to low disk space, or deleted if the user clears their browser cache?
- When it hits your origin, _all_ quota-managed storage mechanisms get purged. The way if it hits your origin gets decided is by looking at all quota-managed storage mechanisms of all origins and then purging by LRU.
  - Quota-managed storage mechanisms are: cache storage, IDB, service worker, media license, OPFS, Web SQL (the last is of course soon history).
- The library uses the OPFS, the origin private file system, and requires a web worker context.

- ## "Browsers will not serve Wasm files from file:// URLs" and that a web server is required, along with setting 2 response headers.

  - What about inside a Chrome extension? Can extensions create a SQLite database using SQLite wasm and OPFS?
- Files in Chrome extensions like https://localhost (not file://), it is a secure context.
  - Why does it need the "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy" and "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy" HTTP headers? Because it is the security requirements of SharedArrayBuffer.
  - Furthermore, Chrome extension does support these two HTTP headers. 
  - üëâüèª In summary, SQLite Wasm with SharedArrayBuffer works in Chrome extension.
- Service worker and web worker are different. You can read their introductory article. Here, createSyncAccessHandle is a sync IO method, so it only works in web worker by design. 
  - You can create a web worker in extension pages, e.g. the popup page or any web pages in your extension.
  - Content scripts are out of extension origin. You should only use sqlite in your extension origin.
  - You can't create web worker in service worker at present. Some extension developers propose that web workers can be created in service worker.

- As mentioned earlier, there's a missing API in service workers which means the OPFS SQLite implementation doesn't work at the moment.
