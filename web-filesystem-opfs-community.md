- ## Very excited about OPFS support in browsers but performance still has a long time to go.

  - Reading a local file (4 MB) taking 170ms in Chrome and 570ms in Safari doesn't feel right to me.
- Not sure about reads but Chrome is very very slow at writes on Mac
- I got someone to try those benchmarks on a Linux and Window machine. It's a little more like Safari is faster on Mac than, chrome was slow. A little disappointing. But we don't have larger numbers of inserts outside of a wrapped transaction. So not impacted too much.

- ## [logseq-webapp, no browser support_202301](https://github.com/logseq/logseq/discussions/8183)
- I think they are using Linux. The file protocol used by Logseq currently has bad support for browsers or Linux.
  - The team plans to transition to OPFS in the future. Hopefully that resolves the issue

- ## [Moving local files with the File System Access API](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/805)
  - When launching SyncAccessHandles, we launched `FileSystemFileHandle.move()` for files within the Origin Private File System (OPFS). 
  - Moving of files outside of the OPFS and moving directories at all are not yet supported.
  - We're proposing to allow the FileSystemFileHandle.move() method to move files that do not live in the Origin Private File System, i.e. user-visible files on the device.

- ## A new RxStorage has been released. rx-storage-opfs
- https://twitter.com/rxdbjs/status/1646541842584854529
  - It is based on the #OPFS API and much faster compared to #IndexedDB. 
  - Atm this is the fastest persistend storage for browsers.

- ## Do you know what persistence is like in Chrome? 
- https://twitter.com/tomayac/status/1613605318407094275
  - Say my website dumps 1 GB of data in an OPFS SQLite database. Does that get persisted similar to IndexedDB? Like will it get evicted(È©±ÈÄêÔºåËµ∂Âá∫) due to low disk space, or deleted if the user clears their browser cache?
- When it hits your origin, _all_ quota-managed storage mechanisms get purged. The way if it hits your origin gets decided is by looking at all quota-managed storage mechanisms of all origins and then purging by LRU.
  - Quota-managed storage mechanisms are: cache storage, IDB, service worker, media license, OPFS, Web SQL (the last is of course soon history).
- The library uses the OPFS, the origin private file system, and requires a web worker context.

- ## "Browsers will not serve Wasm files from file:// URLs" and that a web server is required, along with setting 2 response headers.

  - What about inside a Chrome extension? Can extensions create a SQLite database using SQLite wasm and OPFS?
- Files in Chrome extensions like https://localhost (not file://), it is a secure context.
  - Why does it need the "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy" and "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy" HTTP headers? Because it is the security requirements of SharedArrayBuffer.
  - Furthermore, Chrome extension does support these two HTTP headers. 
  - üëâüèª In summary, SQLite Wasm with SharedArrayBuffer works in Chrome extension.
- Service worker and web worker are different. You can read their introductory article. Here, createSyncAccessHandle is a sync IO method, so it only works in web worker by design. 
  - You can create a web worker in extension pages, e.g. the popup page or any web pages in your extension.
  - Content scripts are out of extension origin. You should only use sqlite in your extension origin.
  - You can't create web worker in service worker at present. Some extension developers propose that web workers can be created in service worker.

  - [SQLite Wasm in the browser backed by the Origin Private File System - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sqlite-wasm-in-the-browser-backed-by-the-origin-private-file-system/)

- As mentioned earlier, there's a missing API in service workers which means the OPFS SQLite implementation doesn't work at the moment.
