- ## Do you prefer @tldraw to @excalidraw ?

  - Excalidraw is ahead on features, TLDraw is ahead in my heart
- I like the code a lot more than the Excalidraw code, and I've learned a ton from following @steveruizok's work over the years

- ## meeting Steve and spending the day understanding @tldraw ’s vision (not as “another excalidraw”, but an embeddable canvas for everyone)

- ## A tangent thread is about how spatial canvases come into play. 
- https://twitter.com/chrisshank23/status/1663296920150999040
  - Particularly thinking about @tldraw 's early vision to provide a platform for other to build spatial canvases...
- I see a gap between unstructured spatial canvases and meaningful, structured diagramming tools. Spatial canvases nudge you to create your own conceptual framework for a task. Diagramming tools are domain-specific and have little extensibility.
  - The unstructured nature of a spatial canvas likely manifests in its implementation of a bunch of lines/shapes with coordinates that you move around. These shapes have no inherent relationship or meaning in the data representation only the human perceiving the canvas.

- What's cool is that the "nextgen" spatial canvases like @excalidraw and @tldraw are starting to explore this a little. 
  - For example, both have the first-class concept of arrows/lines connecting shapes together!
