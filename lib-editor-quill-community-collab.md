- We tried to implement track changes / suggestions with QuillJS and came relatively far. But in the end it did not really work, since OT (Operational Transform, the format for syncing the changes) does not support hierarchical structures. The
  - Team from CKEditor changed the OT to support this. But unfortunately it seems to be a lot of work and their code is closed
  - Also Google solved it with OT, but also their code is not open. 
  - So to my knowledge there is up to today no Open Source solution to solve track changes / suggestions with html. And no one seems to be willing to do this, since the effort seems to be very high. So our conclusion: We stopped with this approach.

- Prosemirror has also a relative positioning format, but it's not OT, they call it a step. This seems to be more flexible and the doc structure of Prosemirror is similar to the DOM structure of a html document.

- Other approaches / inspirations
  - NIB
  - Fidus Writer
  - Wax Prosemirror
