- Richard Hipp (creator of SQLite) had this to say about Rust and SQLite in the comments:
  - > Rewriting SQLite in Rust, or some other trendy ‚Äúsafe‚Äù language, would not help. In fact it might hurt.
  - Prof. Regehr did not find problems with SQLite. He found constructs in the SQLite source code which under a strict reading of the C standards have ‚Äúundefined behaviour‚Äù, which means that the compiler can generate whatever machine code it wants without it being called a compiler bug. That‚Äôs an important finding. But as it happens, no modern compilers that we know of actually interpret any of the SQLite source code in an unexpected or harmful way. We know this, because we have tested the SQLite machine code ‚Äì every single instruction ‚Äì using many different compilers, on many different CPU architectures and operating systems and with many different compile-time options. So there is nothing wrong with the sqlite3.so or sqlite3.dylib or winsqlite3.dll library that is happily running on your computer. Those files contain no source code, and hence no UB.


- ## Nobody is feasibly going to rewrite Sqlite in Rust.

  - Is making a file based database that hard, compared to creating new programming language for example ?

- If you gave me two year I'm not sure I could implement a filesystem API that correctly did something as simple as "atomically append to a file". See also Dan Luu's writing on the topic of filesystems

- The problem is to write a reliable file database. 
  - Firefox got a lot of bugs related to history file corruption until it was replaced with SQLite. 
  - The same story was with Subversion where they replaced Berkeley key DB due to reliability issues.
  - This reliability comes from a very deep knowledge of OS API and all their corner cases. 
  - Creating a programming language typically involves less corner cases and the bugs in the compiler/runtime are much simple to reproduce (again, typically).

- What did SQLite gave us? SQL.
  - XML schemas are gnarly, SQL schemas are easy.
  - Primary keys are great. Foreign keys are gorgeous.
  - Constraints on columns are handy.
  - :memory: is awesome for unit-tests.
- A lot of user applications store some or all their state in sqlite, firefox being a prominent example. That is what embeddable databases are designed for. It is not frequently used as an exchange format though, because it is no designed to be a good exchange format.
- Why is it not a good exchange format? Relational tables are an excellent exchange format, and SQLItes is specifically designed to be portable across time and architectures.
  - It's only unportable if you do something like use platform serialization to store your data structures in blobs. Don't do that, or serialize them to JSON/XML/etc before putting them in a blob.

- Also most data in iPhone apps is stored in sqlite files. Rip apart an iphone backup some time and peek at the contents.
