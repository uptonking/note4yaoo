- ## [[RFC]Â React-admin v5_202311](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/issues/9462)
- The main constraint of this version is to be a painless migration from v4.
- We intend to release version 5 in early 2024.

- Breaking Changes
  - react-query to @tanstack/react-query
  - Remove cloneElement in inputs by introducing an input name prefix context
  - Make all input width 100% by default (to make this page nicer)

- Out Of Scope
  - Framework-agnostic library (to pave the way for Svelte Admin, Astro admin, etc)
  - Turn react-admin into a server-side rendering framework. We believe that SPAs are still the best architecture for admins.
