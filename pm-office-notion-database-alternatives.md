- ## [Self-hosted Notion alternative with first-class markdown support? : r/selfhosted _202504](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kbcnoe/selfhosted_notion_alternative_with_firstclass/)
- I need to find a self-hosted Notion alternative that has 2 main features:
  - Notion-like databases / collections with relations
  - Markdown editor and easy markdown export.

- As far as I'm aware there is nothing open source / selfhosted which allows you to do databases the way Notion does.
  - True. Outline has a really good feature set, it only misses the databases. Otherwise i love it!

- I don't like SiYuan. It does not run offline and requires an online connection to run a local database. The developer commented that this is intended functionality and will not allow offline usage.
  - The device sync is also a bit of a cash grab and doesn't work with the self hosted implementation. You have to remain logged in to an account run by the developer to get this premium feature.
  - The fact that you need to maintain a connection to their servers at all time seems to defeat the point of self hosting it.

- Even if you don't want to hear it - Obsidian and Logseq are the best, even if not web-based. You could also try Trilium Notes. Still, there isn't any perfect solution, but Obsidian is thanks to it's plugin mechanic the most flexible and powerfull.

- TriliumNext/Notes It's basically SiYuan but less bloated more open. Also has a sweet Android app!

- ## Alternative for Notion
- https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/qhm1v2/alternative_for_notion/
- The best alternative to notion is actually trilium. 
  - Gallery view like notion via book note
  - tables nt databases, but over notion, tables in trilium support embedding of images directly
  - What it does not have

    - notion like database sorting of tables
    - notion like filters for tables
    - notion like backlinks again not sure about this
    - notion like kanban

- There are two pieces of software I'm eagerly waiting for. 
  - Anytype who someone already mentioned, and Appflowy.

- ## Notion alternatives? And why I want to switch.
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/ser139/notion_alternatives_and_why_i_want_to_switch/
- Specific grievances that influence my opinion are:
  - No offline support: flaky UX anywhere there is a flaky connection, including at my home
  - Second class mobile experience: no multitasking on iOS / Android, no zoom, and if you use mobile, the website has a banner you can’t X out of
  - No on-premises data support: I can’t have custody of my data in case I want to, say, store sensitive data in Notion. I must trust the probably great but possibly flawed Notion team I’ve never met.
  - Search is buggy: sometimes pages don’t show up, and I have no idea why. Search is slow. I generally don’t trust it.
  - Flaky handling of uploads: I can’t tell you how often I’ve thought I stored an important image, only to find out the upload silently failed.

- The only thing I wasn't able to replace was Notion's highly featured database system, but I found a better workaround.
- Notes
  - I used Obsidian and then switched to Craft. 
  - Obsidian was nice because it was free and all your data was yours. Uses markdown formatting, supports backlinks, and a whole slew of potential with third party extensions. 
  - I eventually switched to Craft because it did what I needed to do in a more fluent manner. 
  - Craft required less adjustments and was a much more opinionated software.

- Task/Project Management
  - I use Asana for my big project management now. It's a premium/subscription service for some of the better features, but it gets the job done and has offline support.

- Basic todo list
  - I use Things 3 for my basic every day tasks. Sure it's pricey but the app does not disappoint.

- Calendar: I use Fantastical. 
  - People hate on it ever since it switched to a subscription model but it is undeniably the best calendar app out there, especially if you manage multiple calendars across different services (Google Calendar + Outlook Calendar). And it has this magical feature where if I drag a task from Things 3 over to Fantastical, it makes a calendar event!

- Task Management + to do + calendar
  - For a while I used Ticktick and realized it was the closest I ever got to an all-in-one workspace that had offline support
  - Filters, tags, kanban view, calendar view, Eisenhower view, etc. Ticktick had it all! And when life slowed down and I only needed simple to-do lists, Ticktick did that too. 
  - The only issue I had when I used Ticktick two years ago was that the iOS/iPadOS app received updates much sooner than macOS app, which made using it on both platforms very difficult as I could see everything on my phone, but not on my laptop. 
  - Hopefully this has been fixed, but I just don't need an all-in-one workspace anymore.

- Breaking everything down into their separate apps has made the experience doing each thing much better. 
  - Notion was nice to use because everything was in one place. It was the jack of all trades, master of none, but it was never better than any master of one. 

- I’ve tried out a lot of recommended Notion alternatives, and no apps really come close to touching the full-fat feature set, aesthetics, functionality and community of Notion. 
  - As others have mentioned, apps such as Obsidian, Logseq and Roam and are great at what they do, which is essentially pure notetaking, but they do not contain database features 
  - (although it is worth mentioning that Obsidian with its DataView plugin can replicate most functions of a Notion database, albeit in a manner that’s very user unfriendly. Still, it’s amazing what can be achieved with Obsidian, a few plugins, and plain markdown files).
- Some other alternatives that do **include database features** include Coda, Airtable, MS Excel, ClickUp and a few new upstarts like Appflowy, which looks promising but is in a very early stage of development. 
  - Focalboard also looks decent, and so does Microsoft Loop, which while probably not be self-hosted or open source, will likely be widely adopted across Microsoft 365 companies.

- I tried switching to Obsidian initially - and I was able to recreate my Notion database heavy workflow within the Dataview plugin. 
  - However, sync just got too tedious to manage, and using YAML frontmatter was not a great experience for managing Notion-like “databases”. 
  - The lack of block-based editing was also a significant con

- ## Anyone has an *offline* alternative for Notion in terms of database?
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/jzgrk2/anyone_has_an_offline_alternative_for_notion_in/
- Try Trilium. It's open source, self hosted, free, and pretty damn good.
- The ease of putting pages in database rows still makes Notion a better option, but clicking through data surely isn't as fast as my old spreadsheet.

- ## How to share a filtered view of a table to a guest user, and prevent them to check the full table by changing views / accesing the source database?
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/dk1vys/how_to_share_a_filtered_view_of_a_table_to_a/
- 2 years later I am having the same issue. 
- I found a solution to show an empty database if the recipient would click on the title of a database I had specifically filtered for them.
  - I made my original mother-database completely empty by putting a condition that is always false. In my case I chose to put a delivery date to a date where nothing happened (before I used Notion).

- ## Bangle.io - A fully local serverless Notion alternative
- https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/rnnj96/bangleio_a_fully_local_serverless_notion/
- some of the things that differentiate bangle from just a vanilla markdown editor:
  - WYSIWYG editor - countless editors force the user to look at a split view of raw and formatted markdown.
  - It support workspaces, tags, backlinks to name a few.
  - I am working hard to add an open API to make it extensible.
  - Is speedy and fast, not an electron bloatware.
  - No data hostage - allows you to edit your locally saved markdown notes write from the web app.
  - Has powerful vs-code like command palettes and keyboard shortcuts.
