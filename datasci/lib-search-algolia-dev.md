## [Prefix searching | Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/override-search-engine-defaults/in-depth/prefix-searching/)

- Prefix matching is central to Algoliaâ€™s as-you-type search experience. 
- This is already useful in avoiding insufficient results. 
  - ðŸ’¡ But you can also use prefix matching to bring back even more results.
- Algoliaâ€™s prefix search is configurable, with three available `queryType` modes depending on the use case. Every index can be configured independently.
  - `prefixLast` (default) - where only the last word is a prefix, and the rest are treated as full words
  - `prefixAll` - where all separate text in a query is treated as a prefix
  - `prefixNone` - disables all prefixing. treats none of a search queryâ€™s words as prefixes; all words are considered complete and only records containing matches for every query word will be returned.

- Note that the order of the matched words in the result doesnâ€™t need to be the same as the order of the prefixes in the search query.
