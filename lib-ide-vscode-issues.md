- ## [How to customize the right-click context menu ? _202305](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/182592)
  - As vscode upgrades and installs more and more extensions, the right-click context menu is getting longer and longer than the screen height
- So 7 years later, this feature still not be supported yet ?

- ## [User configurable menus _201607](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/9285)

- FYI and yes it isn't the full deal yet but since a few milestones you can hide menu items from toolbar. 

- ## [Allow to change the font size and font of the workbench](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/519)
- We're approaching 9 years since this issue was opened! Can we get to 10?
