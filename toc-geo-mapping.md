## map-app

- https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling
  - This template is designed to accelerate building out a "scrollytelling" map story.
    - The output is an HTML and JavaScript file. 
    - These outputs can be hosted on any web-accessible location, with no extra code or infrastructure required. 
    - Note that embedding the output as an iFrame in another page will not work as expected. The scroll-driven interface requires the full page.
  - The template does not rely on any particular CSS framework, fonts, or images. 
    - There are some basic styles in the head of the HTML file that can be changed
