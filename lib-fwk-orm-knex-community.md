- ## üÜöÔ∏è [How is Node.js Knex similar/different to Sequelize? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56028287/how-is-node-js-knex-similar-different-to-sequelize)
- Sequelize is full blown ORM forcing you to hide SQL behind object representation. 
  - Knex is plain query builder, which is way too low level tool for application development.
  - Better to use objection.js it combines good parts of ORMs without compromising power of writing any kind of SQL queries.

- ## [PgBouncer transaction pooling vs. Knex pooling? _201902](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/3069)
- Using pg-pool for handling pooling when running knex in multiple processes sounds like nice idea. 
  - I have usually just set databases connection limit to (knex instance count * knex pool size), but having external shared connection pool might be a better choice in some cases, for example where you are not able to tune database settings to allow huge connection counts.

- ## [How to use `partition by` with knex?](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/3391)
- Seems that partition by with order is not supported by Knex. like partition by user_id order by created_at asc

- Is there an alternative for this? E.g. a mixture of Knex functions with raw db query to create table with partitions using Knex migration?
  - There is an example that has worked for me.

- ## üêõ [No option to partitioning a table _201710](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/2289)
- Partitioning option is available for all knex supported databases
  - But 'Partitioning By' is available in following databases

- postgres 10.3 use PARTITION BY RANGE that is not supported by knex and I think also not supported from ORMs

- ## [Knex Support for Read Replicas - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47957116/knex-support-for-read-replicas)
  - Does Knex support routing queries to MySQL read replicas like Sequelize does? If so, how can I accomplish this?
- Not supported currently in knex (0.14). To accomplish something similar you need to create multiple knex instances and explicitly send read queries to read replica knex instances and write queries to master instance. There has been discussion about implementing this feature, but I don't think that anyone is currently working on it.

- If DB driver supports the feature, it might be possible to use with knex also.

- ## [nodejs pg split read/write request to database - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70980495/nodejs-pg-split-read-write-request-to-database)
- You can create two Pool instances with the different host urls for the master and replica DBs 

- ## [Read Write Replica Delay _201709](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/2250) 
  - I am trying u use mysql read write replica, i created 2 connection the knex config file, and i am using the read configuration for read queries and write configuration for write queries, 
  - The problem is that the read replica of mysql server are updated by the master server (which handles write queries) in 20ms, so if we do read immediately after write we dont get the new data there.

- this sounds like a really bad idea in multiple ways (trying to create pseudo synchronous replication setup with application side code).
  - I would just suggest to configure replication setup to work in synchronous manner and that way DB know when to lock (it slows down writes a bit, but it sounds like a lot loss of a problem). Also this effectively limits your write speed to < 10 writes per second or those delays will block all your DB reads...
  - You could implement functionality you need for example with rxjs, that always before making query you'll pass them through rxjs, pipe which always waits your delay in case of write operation is being done... knex doesn't help you much with this.

- ## [Seprate Read And Write Support _201502](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/703)
  - Are there plans to support, writing to master and reading from a read-replica just by a simple config?

- That would be an interesting feature. It's something that would require a number of very substantial changes so it's not something you'll see for quite a while
  - Right now only `node-mysql` supports clustering and we'd need uniform support in order to do this.
  - This request is definitely a helpful data point in thinking about how to structure the pool API. We'd need to at least have a synchronous API for checking whether a connection was available from the read pool and preferentially using that. If not, we'd need to carefully think through how to choose which pool to make an async connection request to (read only or duplex).

- ## [[Help]: need figure out how to do Read/Write Splitting with mysql _201703](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/1951)
- As i know mysql now support cluster model, could you please help me to figure out how to do Read/Write Splitting with knex?

- How do you do read/write splitting directly with node-mysql driver? Do you have separate IP where to send reads and other for writes or does mysql know how to route queries correctly from any of the nodes?
  - Sounds like you need to create 2 knex instances, one for master and one for slave and select by hand each query where to send them... What happens if master goes down? Is one of the slaves promoted to master automatically? How the client code gets information about that? Is there list of IPs in slave configuration? Sorry, I don't know exactly how mysql clustering works and I don't have time to look into it right now, so I might not be much of help.

- ## ü§î [Customize connection pool and/or queries for cluster instances _201710](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/2253)

- Currently not supported. I wrote a quick (and dirty) work around that just juggles Knex instances until Knex can be updated with specific functionality.

- The "simple" way is to have a knex handle for writes and a knex handle for reads.

- I have approached it by separating knex instance of read and write. However, within read and write, one may want to use multiple connection hosts vs relying on a single server and creating a new knex instance for each host is lot of manual work + waste of resources.

- I've set up a Connection Pool and added the WRITER and READER endpoints from the Aurora cluster. Then each time I execute a query I regex it to see if it only contains selects.

- having read/write routing inside the pool would be a solution
  - I would like to propose having this above the pool, as a router/layer that possibly encapsulates multiple tagged pools and serves acquire() requests using tags

- Having load balancing in db driver has many advantages by removing all the intermediate services (pgpool/virtual interfaces). 

- I am trying u use mysql read write replica, i created 2 connection the knex config file, and i am using the read configuration for read queries and write configuration for write queries, 
The problem is that the read replica of mysql server are updated by the master server (which handles write queries) in 20ms, so if we do read immediately after write we dont get the new data there.
- this sounds like a really bad idea in multiple ways (trying to create pseudo synchronous replication setup with application side code).

- [The future of Objection.js ¬∑ Vincit/objection.js _202211](https://github.com/Vincit/objection.js/discussions/2463)
  - The main reason for this is that Objection's typescript typings would need a full rewrite for them to become competitive and up to today's high standards for typescript codebases. 
  - I simply don't have time, or quite frankly the interest, to do that. 
  - Objection was designed before typescript was widely adopted

- If you like knex's query builder and objection.js's relation capabilities, sutando is a better alternative

- This is likely going to be an unsatisfying recommendation but all those who have felt the pain for long enough will agree - just use a query builder. 
  - Knex is great and while there's marginally more boilerplate, it's easy and extensible.

- The reason why I'm not satisfied with Prisma (and other ORMs that lack of SQL optimization such as GORM in Go)

- ## üöÄ [Knex and Bookshelf ‚Äì ORM for JavaScript | Hacker News _201312](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6871725)
- üÜöÔ∏è how does Bookshelf compare to Sequelize in terms of maturity and feature set
  - I'd actually created Bookshelf after seeing a lack of good support for SQL abstractions in javascript, especially comparison to other languages and frameworks.
  - In terms of maturity, Bookshelf & Knex are still definitely young and a work in progress, but fairly mature in the sense that they are both heavily inspired (and in Knex's case, mostly copied) from the excellent Laravel PHP framework's query builder and ORM. 
  - Bookshelf also adapts different conventions I found useful from Backbone.js' Models, Collections, and Events - I'm also aiming to eventually make the libraries usable outside of Node (webSQL or otherwise).
  - I've been looking to take the best from other languages' data interfaces and try to adapt them into a few great packages for javascript, as opposed to completely re-inventing the wheel.
  - Some of the differentiating features include eager-loading and nested eager-loading relations, the ability to constrain those relations, polymorphic relations, a distinct separation between the ORM and the query builder layer, and until recently transactions 
  - üêõ Some things that Bookshelf doesn't have out of the box are explicit typecasting (hooks exist to handle this if you need, but most times the db takes care of this for you) or validations (IMO out of scope for Bookshelf/Knex, but something I'll have incorporated in my next database package), and static finder methods User.find(1), User.findOrCreate({...}) - easily added but these will also come in the next package in progress.
  - Bookshelf aims to be a simple Data-Mapper, rather than a full out Rails ActiveRecord style ORM... This is something that will be a different project entirely which I'm actively working on building out. Sitting atop of Bookshelf, it will include scopes, validators, callbacks, helper methods, etc

- Any thoughts on migrations with Bookshelf?
  - Bookshelf is running on top of Knex.js, so I suppose you can use its migration features
- I've used node-db-migrate on some toy projects in conjunction with Bookshelf, and it seemed to work fine.
