- ## If you're building a callback API, make the callback async. You'll thank me later.
- https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1766549359452405955
  - My hot take is that events are not great. I may use events internally, but I'd never expose events from an API in 2024. Methods are more flexible and can be overloads.
  - I have stopped using events. Methods are better, and can overloaded.

- What if you want more than one subscriber?
  - Call the method multiple times

- Would be good if C# team could unify the sync and async dichotomy like Go.

- Then the API needs to fully reenterly and thread safe from any point the callback is called.

- And use ValueTask

- Try Infisical. You can self host it.

- We use Doppler

- Just self-host a Passbolt instance. It's literally created for scenarios like this.

- ## 🤔 What are your thoughts on early returns?
- https://x.com/schlimmson/status/1870122088100725244
- Guards are great, there is a reason modern languages like Swift or Rust have them built in

- Personally, I prefer using early return instead of wrapping everything into multiple if/else statements. This reduces the load on the reader’s mind later, makes it easier to understand and trace the flow, and eliminates the need for excessive nesting.

- early returns are one way to reduce the number of code paths through a function (often called cyclomatic complexity).

- ## 🤼🏻 提示一下各位同学，1）在项目中的代码最好全用相对URL路径，如果要用绝对的话，最好支持一个BasePath的配置（Java的项目都会有一个app）。
- https://x.com/haoel/status/1610116273937211396
  - 2）在 URL 路径管理上一定要收口，收到一个统一的地方，不要放任
- 不光是 js 生态，大部分流行的 web 框架都是用根 / 来定位的，因为用相对路径引入的问题会更多，更加混乱。我觉得这种情况还是框架层面支持比较好，开发者还是用 / 来定位，框架进行重写，开发者无感知。
  - 我粗略看了一下code-server他们的代码，好像和我说的一样是在框架层面处理的，把内部视图返回的根路径加个前缀，在内部视图的逻辑里还是按照“根”来定位的。以我个人 Web 开发的经验来说，相对路径能不用还是不用的，非常容易出 bug。
- 嗯，我也说了，只有两种方式，一种是全相对，一种是绝对加basePath，像Java那样。然后，一定要把路径管理收口掉，不然，无论你怎么做都是Bug一堆。

- 第一，手工在源代码中维护相对路径是反人性的，因为修改一个东西的路径后要修改它指向别人的所有相对路径。 编写时使用绝对路径，编译为相对路径，这是可以接受的。
  - 第二，这源代码里面直接用字符串操作来插入 base path 的做法看着就觉得不安全，最好还是用封装好的库来进行路径运算，例如 JS 里面的 new URL(path, basePath)。

- ## Controversial opinion: booleans in user-facing APIs are almost always the wrong thing.
- https://x.com/elithrar/status/1844066772938522731
  - Enums are better, self-documenting, easier to grow over time, and make handling the "null" state easier.
  - Also: some languages like Go treat the absence (default value) of a boolean as false, which can be tricky - you don’t know if the user explicitly passed false or not.(Pointer types can help, but it’s a sharp edge)

- Totally agree. Enums can be problematic because consumers expect these to be a rigid set. It means you either make sure enums are “open” or you’re potentially facing a breaking api change if you add a new member. Not always the case, painful when it is.

- Great for TS, though I hate relying on JS string matching for enums though 🙃 better have good Intellisense

- ## 🆚️ concurrency is NOT parallelism. 提供了动画示例
- https://x.com/NikkiSiapno/status/1840656501461184549
  - One is about managing multiple tasks at once, intermixing them to optimize resource usage.
  - The other involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
  - In modern systems, concurrency is driven by design principles that ensure tasks or processes run efficiently, whether the hardware has one or multiple processors. 
  - Even with a single CPU, concurrency patterns allow tasks to share processor time effectively. This creates an illusion of parallel execution.
  - While concurrency is about dealing with many tasks at once (task management). Parallelism is about doing many tasks at once (task execution).
  - Parallelism requires hardware support, such as multi-core or multi-processor systems, to allow different tasks to run at the same time.
  - This distinction between concurrency (task management) and parallelism (task execution) significantly impacts application performance and efficiency.
  - Parallelism is particularly beneficial for compute-intensive applications, where tasks can be distributed across multiple processors to be executed simultaneously, leading to faster and more efficient processing.
  - Asynchronous programming is used to achieve concurrency in single-threaded environments. This approach enables a program to initiate tasks without waiting for previous ones to finish, managing multiple tasks in a non-blocking manner.
  - A great example is Node.js, which handles concurrency in a single-threaded model using callbacks and event loops.
  - Meanwhile, multi-threaded environments (eg; C#) facilitate both concurrency and parallelism. They facilitate both concurrent task execution and true parallel execution across multiple processors or cores simultaneously.

- How to avoid data racing in parallelism?

- ## Regarding DI and IoC in AdonisJS, the choice is yours. You can ditch DI and all that "OOP" in your userland code or fully embrace hexagonal architecture and DDD principles.
- https://x.com/romainlanz/status/1838475431789441081
  - We're a tool to help you build, not to lock you in.
  - Note that I'm taking the extreme here. You can also easily build a standard MVC or n-tier application, using DI only where you truly need it.

- ## How old were you when you figured out dependency injection was just “arguments”
- https://x.com/jacobmparis/status/1839287139592450389
- Dependency injection is just the practice of making your code impossible to statically analyze as a regular human being, since configuration can make it run completely differently. Absolutely hate working with codebases that use it.

- ## "exposing platform APIs over wrapping them" that really stuck with me, 
- https://twitter.com/jimniels/status/1774808433675719106
  - especially when I found myself trying to get `<meta>` tags into a Next.js app I was working on.
- That's why Remix replaced the meta object syntax with the array of objects (keys/values of meta or custom tagName) syntax in v2. There were just too many ways to represent the meta tags. This gives control back to the developer.
- The metadata API in next.js serves an important purpose: to ensure that we can send the head for bots & crawlers in the initial HTML
  - If you don't care about that purpose you are free to render meta tags anywhere you like and React will hoist them to the head element

- ## 🧩 A simple introduction to "The workflow event pattern: a reactive architecture."
- https://twitter.com/RaulJuncoV/status/1769703136124391486
  - The main issue with async communication is error handling.
- The Producer asynchronously passes data through a message channel to the event consumer.
- If the Consumer experiences an error while processing the data, it delegates that error to the Processor and moves on to the following message.
  - The Consumer doesn't spend time dealing with errors, and the responsiveness is not affected.
- Once the workflow processor receives an error, it tries to figure out what is wrong.
- This could be:
  - A static and deterministic error handler.
  - Some ML algorithms analyze the message to see anomalies in the data.
- The Processor changes the original data to try to repair it and then sends it back to the originating queue.
- The event consumer sees this message and tries to process it again. Hopefully, with some success this time.
- If the workflow processor can't determine what is wrong, it sends the message off to a "dashboard."
- The human in the loop will take care of the cases in the dashboard and resubmit them to the original queue.
- This pattern is a reactive architecture. 

- ## 🧮 Mastering the sliding window method is a competitive edge in coding interviews.
- https://twitter.com/Franc0Fernand0/status/1750079118803165429
  - A sliding window is a subarray that moves from left to right through an array.
  - The window is defined by two pointers representing its left and right bound. The window size can be fixed or variable.
  - For fixed size, the idea is to calculate some information about the elements in the window efficiently.
  - For variable size, the idea is to find the best one that fits a particular constraint efficiently.

- ## Dependency Injection frameworks are built by very clever groups of very clever engineers in very clever ways to very cleverly avoid simply passing parameters to functions"
- https://twitter.com/omervk/status/1521554504952463361
- I have a love-hate relationship with DI frameworks. On my team we have DI on the server, but not on the client.
  - The server ended up complex, but at least it's easy to access stuff. 
  - The client ended up simpler, but accessing stuff requires passing through TONS of fns and classes
  - Depending on the day I'll find myself wanting us not to have DI on the server or wanting DI on the client. Basically, I'll never be satisfied 

- Actually the problem is overuse of DI based on huge overestimation of the value of isolating unit tests. DI frameworks introduce magic and reduce flexibility. You would indeed be better doing DI manually, and being forced to avoid overuse because otherwise things get insane.
  - In many cases manually DI ends in self-developed DI Framework.

- I really think DI needs to be restricted to singletons keyed by datatype. 90% of the problems with DI arise from trying to cover use cases outside this core competency.

- ## Been updating all our AG Grid examples to use arrow functions. 
- https://twitter.com/SCooperDev/status/1517533660576165888
  - Why? So that if you want to access properties from `this` within your callback it will be correctly scoped to your current class.

- ## api design crew: in a library, should a top level object expose public methods that belong to sub-modules?
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1507682433914834955
  - eg `scene.zoomToFit()` vs `scene.viewport.zoomToFit()` ?
  - 自己比较api的设计风格 d3js vs threejs vs popular-js
- If viewport fits into the mental model of the api, meaning the user should be concerned with it, yes. 
  - If viewport is an internal organization pattern and users should only think about the scene, no.
  - From your minimal example scene.zoomToFit() is cleaner and makes sense to me.
- Depends how big the API is. 
  - If it's very large, you might want to spit everything up into separate namespaces to facilitate tree-shaking. See Firebase's radical refactor to API 9 for instance (although in their case they took it a little too far and sacrificed readability)
  - I believe three.js also did something similar recently

- ## This is precisely why I moved Popmotion away from FP/reactive streams. Hooks/Solid look fine to me, and at class components are messy but fairly straightforward.
- https://twitter.com/mattgperry/status/1498982698613977090
- I think that while the syntax itself is relatively straight forward in cases like this, Solid stays relatively straight forward in more complex situations while React gets weird pretty fast with both hooks and classes.
  - react is explicit, i split my app into effects, state, memo and the view, these are the actual components of it. solid is fine, goes into implicit/magic territory, but if that's a choice why not. solving a count with a periodic fold map that feeds into a DOM: xs is just arbitrary
  - I agree that React is explicit. My argument is that it doesn't scale with complexity as well as Solid and probably Cycle do. In simple situations like this being explicit / procedural (not sure if this is the right word) makes it straight forward but not in complex situations
- It depends who you are (I'm a FP guy) and what is in question.
  - For GUIs I'd still prefer something like React (but Cycle is truly “straightforward”)
  - But for, say react-spring, I found it's implicit FP-ness hard to reason about hence I made a FP wrapper

- ## Thinking in Frontend
- step1: 根据 wireframe 开发 Layout 
- step2: 使用 mock data 开发 UI
- step3: 美化 UI
- step4: 使用 real data from API
- step5: ...

- ## Immutability is good... but all code _does_ have a cost, and that includes copying objects/arrays.
- https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1489670150651580417
  - There are many times that you _can_ truly mutate data safely (especially when it's scoped inside a single function).
- Definitely a valid point in the general sense, but the root problem here was the O(n) spread operation for making copies of native arrays.
  - In a data structure optimized for immutable operations with proper structural sharing, such as the List in ImmutableJS, appending is O(1).
- Most persistent data structures today are implemented as hash trees, not lists, because structural sharing is key to performant immutable updates.
  - This oldie from Rich Hickey has a good explanation of how they work under the hood

- ## Do you keep a “graveyard” for deleted / undid things that might be restored by an undo / redo? Is there a name for that pattern?
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1484113858423836674
- for undo/redo I’ve used two stacks, that contain commands for transforming state. For delete/undelete you use “logical delete”
- Subnote does this. All events exist on a timeline (the primary data structure), including discrete undo/redo which reference a previous event’s id. You can scrub in time to revisit the system state at any moment in time, including states that are unreachable via undo.
- We generate inverse operations for history states, which are stored in memory as a property of the state itself (ie, each op knows how to reverse itself). When a state is no longer relevant, it’s deleted and memory is restored without needing to clean up a graveyard
- I don't have a name but it sounds like a good candidate for an event stream. We inherited a ledger app that stored state and incoherent history. We rewrote it to store time ordered events, then filter/map/reduced the stream to render views and deprecated stored state altogether.
- Depends on how you implement undo/redo. For a multi-user system where there is no single history (i.e. user B’s undo shouldn’t negate user A’s changes) then you record the all history as incremental changes, including undos (reversals)… see Operational Transformation

- ## avoiding edge cases is an under-rated skill
- https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1482140673809653763
  - 很多时候不需要null，只需要用[]表达出数据为空或正在加载
- This is why I love languages like Typescript and Rust which make types have to explicitly opt into nullability. It regularly forces you to question whether something should be nullable to begin with. There are many times where this makes you realize you don't need it.
  - Fully agree. I often allow null to distinguish between “data has not yet been loaded/is not available” vs “there are no items”. Knowing explicitly via the type that these two possible states exist — vs where they don’t — is tremendously valuable.
  - I’ve seen a lot of TypeScript where people expand the type to include the edge cases instead of realizing they didn’t need the edge case at all
- Null arrays can help you distinguish loading state vs empty data.
  - If you want null to indicate that it's still loading, then you can simplify this to be: `(stuff || []).map(...)` 

- ## Something about Redux I don't think most people appreciate enough:
- https://twitter.com/acemarke/status/1482396019417620480
  - "pure reducers" isn't just a stupid requirement or a fancy trick to make the devtools work. 
  - Pure functions are easier to understand and think about.
  - The more code you can write that way, the better.
- This has reshaped how I wrote code even outside of Redux.
  - Example: years ago I was working on a Python service that fetched data from another service, did post-processing to reformat it, and kept that data in memory as a cache so it could respond to client requests.
  - But, all the post-processing mutated the in-memory cache (which was just a bunch of Python dictionaries)
  - I realized it was possible to have a request come in, and due to interrupts, have the endpoint read from the cache in the middle of an update
  - To solve that problem, I had to put a bunch of read/write locks around all accesses of the whole structure.
  - I realized this would be so much easier if the processing worked like a reducer, and we keep a pointer to the current "root cache state", and then if a request comes it the handler just uses the pointer it gets and it knows it's safe to read the whole way through.
  - But overall, this is why you should prefer writing code as "pure functions" by default. Easier to understand, easier to compose, easier to use.
  - So, this _is_ a good reason to use Redux... but applicable even without Redux.
- Related: the idea of selectors, calculating and memoizing derived state on demand has had a huge effect on how I write code in general. It formalized something that vaguely seemed like a good idea into something I can point at and talk about as a design pattern.
  - Yep! Again with the "pure functions" idea, but going the other direction.(and I've repeatedly had to point out that a lot more React could should derive values while rendering rather than trying to set derived data into state! doubly so if it's setting in an effect)

- ## being framework-agnostic
- https://twitter.com/dai_shi/status/1434543349524877317
  - I started developing `jotai` to solve a certain issue in React. 
  - Afterward, I realized that it's more than that, a reactive coding pattern, so to say. 
  - To prove that, `jotai-jsx` is developed as a PoC (for now), which runs jotai app without React.
- So, the answer is useState and useEffect.
  - jotai-jsx's atom+useAtom+useConstant is almost equivalent to React's useState+useEffect+useRef.
- Valtio is also developed to solve an issue in React, but soon made me realize its vanilla part is useful as is.
  - valtio/utils are not tied to React, and most jotai/utils are not tied to react either.
- We use Zustand/Valtio specifically because they are agnostic to the UI rendering layer, so we can isolate our business state for testing/portability/re-usability. 
  - Additionally, it's easier to use with events beyond the UI (e.g. network events) without adding components as glue
- We use Valtio specifically because is not tied to React. One of our applications uses non React layers for specific parts. Valtio allows us to easily connect the different layers. It's such a great library
- #ReactQuery is the same. Though I don’t believe you could run React with it 😆
  - In terms of being framework agnostic, I could just use the Query Client and QueryObserver in other frameworks, correct?
  - You’d want to mimic the life cycles of useQuery as much as possible.
  - https://github.com/DamianOsipiuk/vue-query

- ## API integrations are always 1:1. So the number of required integrations required for interop scales exponentially with the number of apps.
- https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1430568224106508289
  - Files act as a hub around which an open set of apps can interoperate. So the number of integrations scales linearly with number of apps.
- “You can do this with a protocol too”. Yep, any kind of interchange. The more widely supported, the larger the combinatorial space.
  - We don’t see too many federated APIs. Just a few (IMAP, etc). I wonder why?
  - I sense one reason may be that APIs are directly controlled by the SaaS product. It’s private property, rather than neutral territory. Incentives to rent out access, rather than interchange.
- You could also just have them use one protocol. In fact you still need to do this with files, these programs have to all agree to write the same file format. If you can get that level of coordination, there's nothing stopping them from all exposing the same API.
  - The Language Server Protocol is exactly this, using JSON-RPC rather than a file format.

- ## Want an early look at the tldraw renderer?
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1420836276878577665
- The project is exported as two layers, and this is the “lower” of the two: it’s job is to render shapes and run even handlers.
- In this sandbox, we’re passing the renderer a “page” with shapes, together with a state for that page; and then using the renderer’s events to make changes to that page/state.
- the renderer doesn’t actually know what shapes we have, or how to render them, so we also pass it some “shape utilities” that it can use to work with/render the shapes.
- The regular tldraw editor (the second, “higher” layer) works the same way: it’s a collection of shapes, shape utils, and lots of logic around how canvas interactions should effect the page/page’s state.
- Why export both layers? 
  - For one, it’s a great way to experiment with new shapes and interactions without having to bring along all the tldraw-specific stuff. You could build anything on top of this renderer.
  - For another, it’s a good force to keep things small, fast and separate. Improvements are easier to make (and to notice) with the separate packages.
- And as an increasingly professional canvas UI guy Zipper-mouth face it’s a good to have a clean starting point should I need to prototype other kinds of primitives or interactions for clients/work/etc.

- ## I came up with some good patterns that prevent the code from getting mixed up.
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1420502623602552833
- Events are sent from the UI to the state machine, making the UI's event handlers very simple. They just toss events back to the machine.
  - The state machine decides what (if anything) to do with the event. Sometimes that's easy to figure out.
  - Either way, if an event just changes the app state, then it's handled with a regular action. 
  - But if an event changes the document then it's run through a "command".
- Commands create entries in the undo / redo stack. They have two methods: "do" that produces a change and "undo" that produces the opposite change.
  - Other actions lead to "sessions". A session has a lifecycle: it begins, updates many times, and then ends or is cancelled. Sessions produce state changes but they don't add to the undo/redo stack.
  - Sessions themselves can be complex, usually caching "snapshots" of data that are used throughout the session. This helps make behaviors like drawing much more smooth.
  - If a session completes, then it returns a command. This way, an interaction like dragging shapes (or "translating") will "undo" back to where the shapes were before the drag, ignoring all of the changes in between.
  - Since the commands and sessions all just operate on an object, they're really easy to test. I've been good on this rebuild to give everything at least cursory tests as I bring things over.
- My hope with this kind of architecture is that it's easy for a contributor to quickly focus in the part of the app they want to improve. Still bugs with transforming rotated shapes btw—any takers?
- Thanks Steve for your detailed post on state designer and command pattern.
  - I envy the way most of the code you put into the state. It makes individual components light weight.
  - But state is getting scary.

- ## full stack developer Tips, 对于可以为空的的属性

- ## Let's say you submit a form, via POST, to /form. 
- https://twitter.com/jaffathecake/status/1385485629392293890
  - Then, that page uses `pushState({}, '', '/foo')` to change the URL to /foo, without reloading the page.
  - If the user presses refresh, what do _you_ think should happen?
- First rule of form posts: return a 303 redirect (possibly to the same URL) to specifically avoid those kind of cases.
  - So I leave it to browser vendors to define what's best UX for those cases that everyone should avoid

- ## ReactQuery's `staleTime` default is 0ms and this gets a few people scratching their heads every now and then. 
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1385258144549330952
  - The explanation is pretty simple:
  - "How is the data on the screen always up to date?"
  - is a much better question to be asking than
  - "Why is my data not updating?!"
- I also recently discovered this behaviour when I was setting up react-query in a project. 
  - It went against my initial expectation but it does make sense to have 0 as the default to ensure up-to-date data always. 
  - If the concern is too many API request, it is easy to override.

- ## Two hard engineering problems that show up in all systems eventually:
- https://twitter.com/undef_obj/status/1382350128380485642
  - Dealing with distributed state
  - Handling concurrent updates
  - The more you learn about how to address these with different algorithms and systems, the better off you'll be in the long run.
- For enterprise systems I'd add a third:
  - Authorization and governance
  - It's an often overlooked(忽视的) part of enterprise development, but insanely difficult to manage at scale unless it's baked in.
  - Try to break the problem down to a more primitive state. What is authorization? It's taking the triple (user, operation, object) and applying it at runtime. This is state that must be consistent (see original tweet) or authorization is faulty.
  - I like to think of Authorization Metadata in terms of a Lampson Access Control Matrix

- ## It(vuejs) still blows my mind that I can make a living by giving away all the code I write for free.
- https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1382100303206625282
- You can do that because you CHANGE lifes.
- You are living a dream while helping people build the best they can.
- The fact about knowledge is the more you share, more you will get. You are legend mate.
- If you create something amazing, people will want to pay for even free stuff
- Vue is such a beautiful tool. So easy to do and maintain a semi-complex application. Vue Just changed my life. Thank you
- explain this business model
  - Adding value to the lives of others.
  - BUSINESS MODEL - COMPANIES AND GOOD PEOPLE SPONSOR HIS WORK WHICH BENEFITS EVERYONE, NOT JUST THEM.
- Does it blow your mind that companies then take that free code and charge extortionate rates for people to use it
- By the way, you make my job easier. 
- I’m very glad you’re making a living off of it, because me too.

- ## Which approach would you prefer for defining CORS?
- https://twitter.com/lukeed05/status/1369145056460906499
  - Option 1 - an `options` argument. The negative is that this requires addl runtime code *even if* you never enable CORS.
  - Option 2 – a "prepare" hook that lets you do anything.
  - Please note that these would *very likely* be mutually exclusive. AKA, `prepare()` supersedes `options.cors` and vice versa.
- So I think most votes for `Option 1` are so that you don't have to deal with the CORS header names. I get it.
- I like the option 2 because it teach you the headers + you don't have the overhead of thinking how your API maps into actual CORS headers.

- ## How do you prefer to name hooks that provide booleans and their results?
- https://twitter.com/erikras/status/1367029738880061441
  - let foo = useFoo()
  - let isFoo = useFoo()
  - let isFoo = useIsFoo()
- “Asymmetric非对称的 naming” (second) case it the most beneficial, and the most hard to constantly follow
- I never have a single value returned from a hook, I always use an object. 
  - Everytime I ever tried that, I ended up wanting to add more elements to be returned and having to refactor all the consumers of the hook.

- ## Folks who have are familiar with both Protobufs/gRPC and GraphQL (incl Relay/Apollo/Amplify etc) 
- https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1364852210144747522
  - how would you compare/contrast their priorities and ideal usecases?
- I've used both extensively for years (and Avro) I'd rank them GraphQL > Avro > Protobufs which hurts, because I'm a Gopher first. 
  - GraphQL's schema IDL expressiveness and tooling is first-rate. 
  - Avro has amazing back/forward compat tooling, and protobufs is ...protobufs.
  - Clearly my preference is explicit types, good tooling, clear docs, and performance behind that. Avro and protob are within a negligible % of each-other. But Avro works best (along side Apache Parquet) for the long-tail of BI/reporting needs in my org.
  - gRPC on the other hand, multi-plexing stuff screaming fast over HTTP2 between [micro] services feels so fast, you can hardly believe there's a network in the middle, but the cost in debuggability and being stuck with protob is kinda high.
  - I would favor GraphQL for anything "user facing" (incl internal) with a well written schema (in the original schema definition language, not in some "compiles from my language to SDL). For speed, archival, "downstream" reporting, etc I'd take Avro
- Go with REST/GraphQL when you start.
  - Introduce gRPC only when REST/GraphQL does not fit the scope.
- Protobuf suits fast-evolving systems i.e back-end services through “non-breaking” flexibility: versioning, reserved fields, non-breaking name changes (preserves index)
  - GraphQL suits more change-sensitive systems (client-side apps)
- Every technology has an inciting use case, and then we try to extend it and turn it into the uber-tool, sometimes to the detriment of the original tech. The extensibility of both I think is still being determined.

- ## where does the idea that immutability is good come from?
- https://twitter.com/_binary_search/status/1362666809682444289
- Predictability. 
  - we want to easily reason about the code we write. 
  - mutations are not friendly with this, they can be wrong and get *lost* easily.
- I don’t know where the shared belief is coming from 
  - but to me it follows straight from the idea that you its good to be able to reason about code in a small context. 
  - With mutability you have to remember more.
- Having more data that you might not need is better than losing data you might need. 
  - When you mutate, you throw away the old state in the abyss(深渊，无底洞)
- If you pass it into another function you know it will not be mutated. 
  - Also you don’t have to copy the whole data structure just to be sure, 
  - and data structures can be efficiently shared if you know there are no mutations.
- An example, although a bit older, is change detection in components:
  - So if I pass down an object to the component and mutate that object by changing a value, the component doesn't know that something has changed. UNLESS it deeply watches all the object's props
  - If the component could count on the immutability of props, it would only need to watch for reference changes. That is performing much better than deeply watching all props.
- When u want to make undo function 
- People who find synchronization processes costly said that.. immutability is good !!!
