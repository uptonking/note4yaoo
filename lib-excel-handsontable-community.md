- ## ðŸ¤” [WTF is a Walkontable?_201508](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/2716)
- Walkontable is for internal use only. It used to be a separate library, but now it is included to HOT repository and it's core functionality is to render HTML table.

- ## ðŸ¤‘ [Handsontable drops open source for a non-commercial license | Hacker News_201903](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19488642)
- About ag-Grid and Handsontable... I am founder of another JavaScript Grid product. FancyGrid. I know much about this market and situation. 
  - ag-Grid is too popular and trampled all competitors over catching almost all possible commercial clients. It is unreal to compete with them, they killed this market and become monopolist. 
  - Handsontable has no way to do. Now ag-Grid also is going to kill JavaScript Chart Libraries market. 
  - Sorely ag-Grid is too successful and leaves no chance for competitors to survive.
