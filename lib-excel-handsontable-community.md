- ## [Rendering and Scrolling Slow for Large Tables _201606](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3591)
- Virtual scrolling will mitigate this by only creating those elements that are actually visible to the user, which greatly improves performance.

- ## [Virtual rendering for columns doesn't seem to work _201603](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3364)
- Handsontable triggers virtual rendering if there are more columns than visible + defined by `viewportColumnRenderingOffset` . When I changed your grid's width to 200px it worked.

- ## ðŸ¤” [WTF is a Walkontable?_201508](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/2716)
- Walkontable is for internal use only. It used to be a separate library, but now it is included to HOT repository and it's core functionality is to render HTML table.

- ## ðŸ’° [Handsontable drops open source for a non-commercial license | Hacker News_201903](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19488642)

> "Essentially, [Handsontable] was kept running thanks to the money earned from Handsontable Pro. Unfortunately, our observation is that the ratio of commercial to free users is about 1 to 25. Hence, the only way for us to keep investing in the product is to convert more free users into paying."

- About ag-Grid and Handsontable... I am founder of another JavaScript Grid product. FancyGrid. I know much about this market and situation. 
  - ag-Grid is too popular and trampled all competitors over catching almost all possible commercial clients. It is unreal to compete with them, they killed this market and become monopolist. 
  - Handsontable has no way to do. Now ag-Grid also is going to kill JavaScript Chart Libraries market. 
  - Sorely ag-Grid is too successful and leaves no chance for competitors to survive.

- We ( https://sheetjs.com/ ) started from a series of open source projects and offer a slew of related solutions
  - The ratio of customers to open source users is largely useless. 
  - To "convert" users, you need to offer something above and beyond what is available in the open source offering.
  - Unless you have something compelling, people won't "convert" out of altruistic desires. 
  - Unfortunately that's not how business works. 

- ## ðŸš€ [Handsontable - Excel-like table editor in HTML & jQuery | Hacker News_201206](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4162808)
- There is also Dan Bricklin's socialcalc https://github.com/DanBricklin/socialcalc which has some relatively active forks including audreyt's ethercalc
  - For just viewing and editing spreadsheets without social features, you can ignore the servers included, the javascript widget works just fine by itself.
  - Dan Bricklin co-authored VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program for the masses.
