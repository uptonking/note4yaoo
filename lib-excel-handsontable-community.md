- ## üé® [canvas table render _201408](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/1697)
- 201603: Thanks for the suggestion, but we're strongly rooted in the DOM elements approach, so we don't plan changing that in the foreseeable future.

- ## ü§îüí° [What is the proper way to update data that has been returned from an API call after the table was already initialized/constructed? _202001](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/what-is-the-proper-way-to-update-data-that-has-been-returned-from-an-api-call-after-the-table-was-already-initialized-constructed/4030)
  - What is the best/proper way to reload the hands on table data with the data source that has come back from an API call to the server. 

- From what I know, I can think of 3 options:
  - Use `hot.updateSettings({data: updatedData})`; 
  - Use `hot.loadData(updatedData)`; 
  - Use code to update the existing data collection which Handsontable is configured to reference to have all of the updates from the server. 

- there‚Äôs one more method (but if you load more than a few cells it is too overwhelming for the browser) - it‚Äôs the `setDataAtCell` method. It also triggers the `render()` method but it won‚Äôt change the sorting or filtering that is already applied.
  - Besides that the `loadData()` and `updateSettings` > data already call the `render()` method.
  - The same rules apply when you change the data via reference - the `loadData` for the same variable reloads the table without an additional `render()` call 

- ## üêõ [Redux/Immutability issues _202005](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6909)
- The data provided to Handsontable is mutated on plugin instead of being only updated in the internal structure when using redux we need to block using Immutable data structures, this is not good to deal with.
- The thing is that mutating data in React is a bad practise and we get no control over it also when using Redux the data is only changed via a reducer action. With the time i see Handsontable doesn't support very well basic concepts nor React

- in AgGrid i can disable that because they notify me of that change and i can say to update internally or not and in that callback, i would update on redux and prevent the editing internally.

- ## [Update particular cell in Handsontable - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33435741/update-particular-cell-in-handsontable)
- Re-rendering the entire table is the only way Handsontable will allow you to render and it's there for a few good reasons. 
  - First off, it doesn't matter how large your table is since there is virtual rendering in use. This means that it will only render what you can see plus a few more rows. 
  - The other reason why it renders everything from scratch is that it's Handsontable's way of keeping a stateless DOM object. If you started manually rendering specific cells then you could end up with an out of sync looking table.

- ## [Cell Double-Click and Supressing "Edit on Double Click" _201903](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/cell-double-click-and-supressing-edit-on-double-click/3081)
- you can use a native js event. 

- ### [Cell on double click event _201702](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/4087)
  - Is there any possible way to execute a method when you double click on a cell?

- We do not provide any Handsontable double click event.
  - you could track `afterOnCellMouseDown` event. Write down the last clicked element and check the time between clicks. 

- ## [I‚Äôm surprised there‚Äôs not a `contenteditable` option for the renderer?](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/table-cell-styling-and-edit-styling/3216/5)
- The `contenteditable` works for DIV but Handsontable works on TD elements.

- ## [setDataAtCell inside useEffect _202309](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/setdataatcell-inside-useeffect/7138)
  - I am trying to get handsontable to work with websockets to allow multi-user editing. 
  - I have a listener for changes to the selection and that works great, and I can set the border etc. as expected. 
  - But trying to update the cell using hot.setDataAtCell(e.row, e.column, 'test test', 'websocket') does not update the table.
  - The only way I have found to work around this, is to call the update webhook in a `setInterval` , which seems quite brittle
  - So I finally got it working. Simply moved all logic into `afterInit()` and stopped using `useState` in any way at all. Just plain js objects and arrays, set inside that the init function.

- ## [Collaboration guide ](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/discussions/8517)
- 202012: currently we are not in business of answering these topics.

- ## üîÄ [Remove non used dependencies jsonpatch in v9 _202106](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/8140)
- Since the `ObservedChanges` plugin has been removed recently there are still some artifacts in the source code that should be removed. 
  - The `jsonpatch` internal lib is no longer used and can be safely removed. Probably the dependency list on docs should also be updated.

- [Fixed ObserveChanges plugin memory leak ](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/4710)

- ## [Hot to use `setDataAtCell` while editing a cell and not get blured _202103](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/hot-to-use-setdataatcell-while-editing-a-cell-and-not-get-blured/5068)
  - I‚Äôm working on a collaborative sheet, basically someone could change the data of his sheet and broadcast the change to everyone else, and I‚Äôm using setDataAtCell to do that.
  - And the problem occurs when you are editing a cell, meanwhile `setDataAtCell` triggered to set the value of another cell, then you‚Äôll lost focus on the cell and what you‚Äôve been editing.

- ## [Is it possible to delegate filtering from the frontend to the backend _202106](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/discussions/8152)
- The `beforeFilter` hook prints all the information needed to proceed with back-end filtering.
  - Once you get the new dataset you can load it back to Handsontable.

- ## [Constraining HandsOnTable to the size of its parent container - Stack Overflow _201705](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30739926/constraining-handsontable-to-the-size-of-its-parent-container)
- use `width:100%` if the parent has a width. That would take up the whole width. The height is a little harder.

- ## [add column dynamically to handsontable - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15538626/add-column-dynamically-to-handsontable)
- Have you tried use `handsontable('alter', 'insert_col', index, amount)` method? 
  - You can add and remove columns and rows using `alter` method

- A temporarily solution is to maintain a data table dynamically. When a new column is required, update the data structure and reinitiate the whole table. 

- ## ["setData..." methods are asynchronous _201909](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/6245)
  - Executing one of the "getData..." methods such as getDataAtCell or getDataAtRowProp immediately after setDataAtCell or setDataAtRowProp does not return the data that was set with the "setData..." methods. Instead, the old data is returned. This unexpected behavior is not documented in the API Reference (at least not under the methods' references).
  - Wrapping the "getData..." methods in a setInterval allows the new value to be obtained (not included in the fiddle). Of course, an afterChange hook could be used as well.

- I guess it is by design, but `getSourceData()` does not participate in column/row reordering. 
  - If I were trying to retrieve all of the data in the table, with reordering rows/columns and cell changes, but without the filters

- ## [Can I manipulate the table with an external button event? _202108](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/can-i-manipulate-the-table-with-an-external-button-event/5485)
- I would like to sort it out with an external button.

- ## [Instantiate Handsontable with no data - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28050150/instantiate-handsontable-with-no-data)
- You can use `minRows` and `minCols` to instantiate an empty Handsontable instance. Also, the `data` arguments expects an array of arrays, so in your case when you receive an empty array, just wrap it in another one: `data : Array of Arrays (default [ [] ])` .

- ## [Click event swallowed after redraw of custom cell renderer ](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3436)
- I recommend you to use renderer only to render elements. 
  - If you would like to add any logic to elements from the renderer, you can use `beforeOnCellMouseDown`

- ## [Programatically updating data in Handsontable 11.1 - Getting help / Questions - Handsontable Forum _202205](https://forum.handsontable.com/t/programatically-updating-data-in-handsontable-11-1/6128)
  - In our app we only use this kind of methods to improve performance and to not have to reload the whole table at each and every external change or side effect changes
- 
- It‚Äôs expected behavior while using `updateData` method to alter the rows as it does not reset index mapper information and the rows indexes are being changed when you are adding the new ones. 
  - `loadData` however do this and let you add the new rows this way.
- Expanded nestedRows is their default state, that‚Äôs why after adding/deleting the rows they are expanded again. You can alter this behavior by using `collapseAll()` method.

- using loadData() method instead of updateData() as the first one was created specifically for React in mind and works correctly in most cases.

- ## [Rendering and Scrolling Slow for Large Tables _201606](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3591)
- Virtual scrolling will mitigate this by only creating those elements that are actually visible to the user, which greatly improves performance.

- ## [Virtual rendering for columns doesn't seem to work _201603](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/3364)
- Handsontable triggers virtual rendering if there are more columns than visible + defined by `viewportColumnRenderingOffset` . When I changed your grid's width to 200px it worked.

- ## ü§î [WTF is a Walkontable?_201508](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/issues/2716)
- Walkontable is for internal use only. It used to be a separate library, but now it is included to HOT repository and it's core functionality is to render HTML table.

- ## üí∞ [Handsontable drops open source for a non-commercial license | Hacker News _201903](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19488642)

> "Essentially, [Handsontable] was kept running thanks to the money earned from Handsontable Pro. Unfortunately, our observation is that the ratio of commercial to free users is about 1 to 25. Hence, the only way for us to keep investing in the product is to convert more free users into paying."

- About ag-Grid and Handsontable... I am founder of another JavaScript Grid product. FancyGrid. I know much about this market and situation. 
  - ag-Grid is too popular and trampled all competitors over catching almost all possible commercial clients. It is unreal to compete with them, they killed this market and become monopolist. 
  - Handsontable has no way to do. Now ag-Grid also is going to kill JavaScript Chart Libraries market. 
  - Sorely ag-Grid is too successful and leaves no chance for competitors to survive.

- We ( https://sheetjs.com/ ) started from a series of open source projects and offer a slew of related solutions
  - The ratio of customers to open source users is largely useless. 
  - To "convert" users, you need to offer something above and beyond what is available in the open source offering.
  - Unless you have something compelling, people won't "convert" out of altruistic desires. 
  - Unfortunately that's not how business works. 

- After having worked with DataTables, ag-Grid and having evaluated a couple of others I'd say that ag-Grid Enterprise is the best general purpose grid library at the moment.
  - Only for the use case where you really need exactly some kind of Excel look-alike/Excel web viewer, Handsontable Pro or SpreadJS will probably be better for you, as ag-Grid does not really offer a finished solution here and also misses a couple of minor features at the moment.

- ## üöÄ [Handsontable - Excel-like table editor in HTML & jQuery | Hacker News_201206](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4162808)
- There is also Dan Bricklin's socialcalc https://github.com/DanBricklin/socialcalc which has some relatively active forks including audreyt's ethercalc
  - For just viewing and editing spreadsheets without social features, you can ignore the servers included, the javascript widget works just fine by itself.
  - Dan Bricklin co-authored VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet program for the masses.

- `contentEditable` is a terrible hack and difficult to use when you only want a subset of features. You need to blacklist a bunch of events like pasting, keyboard formatting (e.g. ctrl+i, drag and drop and inserting new lines.
