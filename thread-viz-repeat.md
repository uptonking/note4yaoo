- ## I’ve noticed visualization tools love demoing maps.

  - It’s always like “with three clicks, here are the top grossing gas stations in Philadelphia” or whatever. 
  - Vs in reality if you do data science/business intelligence, maps are maybe used 0.1% of the time?
- At my previous company, DataMarket, we put a lot of effort into choropleth maps, as we were working with wordwide and regional socio-economic data. They were used a lot. 
  - At @GRID_hq it’s about everyday work that “gravitates(被吸引到、转向) to spreadsheets”, and we don’t see a strong need.
  - To be clear, I agree with your main point: 99% of use-cases for BI and operational visualizations do not require maps.
- I’m sure there’s plenty of people who use map visualizations all the time. Like, if you work at the US Census Bureau, it’s great.
  - Maps are pretty useful in the real estate industry. Also logistics, retail, etc
- Yes we always laugh at it. Nobody needs maps except documentary producers. It's stupid.
- Also a serious GIS analyst just isn't going to use your BI tool, they're using something like ESRI
