- solve vs resolve
  - to "solve" is to find the solution or answer to a problem based on principles of logic, mathematics, and/or factual evidence.         
    - In other words, "solve" basically means find the solution to a factual problem or challenge **through knowledge and reasoning**.
    - For example, you "solve" a puzzle, and police investigators "solve" criminal cases. 
  - to "resolve" is more like to settle a dispute or implement an acceptable resolution to mitigate or eliminate an issue. 
    - In other words, "resolve" basically means settle or rectify an undesirable, conflict, problem or difficulty that has been encountered. 
    - For example, you can resolve a disagreement between two people through compromises, or you can resolve a computer issue **through troubleshooting**.

- e.g. vs i.e.
  - In formal contexts, I would go with "e.g." and "i.e.", with two periods and without a whitespace
  - are both Latin abbreviations.
  - e.g. stands for exempli gratia and means “for example.” 
  - i.e. is the abbreviation for id est and means “in other words.”
    - id est 意思是 that is
