  - [How is this different than Secure Scuttlebutt? | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35691461)
  - After using Nostr a bit, I don't think there's a huge difference between SSB and it except that **Nostr has no blob sync and they abandoned append-only logs** and use different signing key cryptography.
  - Scuttlebutt just suffers from an inaccessible implementation at the moment, but there is a team coming together to make a working implementation again.

- [nostr: The problem with SSB (Secure Scuttlebutt)](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr#the-problem-with-ssb-secure-scuttlebutt)
  - its protocol is too complicated because it wasn't thought about being an open protocol at all. 
  - It insists on having a chain of updates from a single user, which feels unnecessary to me and something that adds bloat and rigidity to the thing
  - It is not as simple as Nostr, as it was primarily made for P2P syncing, with "pubs" being an afterthought;

## [Introduction to Using ssb-server](https://handbook.scuttlebutt.nz/guides/ssb-server/tutorial)

- ssb-server is a peer-to-peer log store. 
  - Its data model is similar to that of Apache Kafka, and it's part of a pattern that's now referred to as the Kappa Architecture.
- Kappa Architecture is a software architecture pattern. 
  - Rather than using a relational DB like SQL or a key-value store like Cassandra, the canonical data store in a Kappa Architecture system is an append-only immutable log. 
  - From the log, data is streamed through a computational system and fed into auxiliary stores for serving.
