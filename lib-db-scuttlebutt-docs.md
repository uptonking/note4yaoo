## [Introduction to Using ssb-server](https://handbook.scuttlebutt.nz/guides/ssb-server/tutorial)

- ssb-server is a peer-to-peer log store. 
  - Its data model is similar to that of Apache Kafka, and it's part of a pattern that's now referred to as the Kappa Architecture.
- Kappa Architecture is a software architecture pattern. 
  - Rather than using a relational DB like SQL or a key-value store like Cassandra, the canonical data store in a Kappa Architecture system is an append-only immutable log. 
  - From the log, data is streamed through a computational system and fed into auxiliary stores for serving.
