```JS
view.state.sliceDoc(v.state.selection.main.from, v.state.selection.main.to)

// How to get all the content of the selected line and replace it no matter where the cursor is in the line
// Exchange `from` with `to`, `anchor`, or `head`, depending on your needs
const line = view.state.doc.lineAt(view.state.selection.main.from)
// Get line contents
const lineContents = view.state.sliceDoc(line.from, line.to)
// Exchange line contents
view.dispatch({ changes: { from: line.from, to: line.to, insert: 'New text for the line' } })
```

- I suspect, from your message, that youâ€™re mutating your decorations, and expecting the method to run then? Thatâ€™s not how these workâ€”they are immutable like everything else you store in your state. You replace them with a widget of the same type to have updateDOM called.

- ## [Dispatch changes without redrawing the widget - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/dispatch-changes-without-redrawing-the-widget/6320)
  - 3 levels of CM6 is working
- updateDOM should be called if a widget of the same type (but non-eq) appears in the same position in the document

- ## ðŸŒ° [Strange cursor behavior when nesting editors - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/strange-cursor-behavior-when-nesting-editors/7101)
- I found this behavior to be due to bad CSS settings for the Dom in the widget, so itâ€™s an oops. Iâ€™m sorry if this wasted your time.

- Editor states, including any values attached to them, should be immutable.

- Try calling requestMeasure on your editor when the animation that pops it up finishes should help.

- ## [Line number after wrapping - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/line-number-after-wrapping/7779)
- Is there a way I could determine the visual line number after wrapping 
  - No. Use direct screen coordinates for that kind of thing.
- Iâ€™m trying to generate the tooltips in the update function of a StateField based on the current selection. Is it reasonable to read screen coordinates from the view there?
  - No. But you canâ€™t know about line wrapping there in general, since that happens on the view level.

- ## [line background layer - v6 - discuss. CodeMirror](https://discuss.codemirror.net/t/line-background-layer/7666)
- It looks like the newlines are not part of the LineBlock items returned by view.viewportLineBlocks. Iâ€™ve verified that by looking at view.state.doc.toString().slice(block.from, block.to)
