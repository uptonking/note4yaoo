  - It’s the wrong spot for one-handed usage. 
  - It should be the opposite, in the lower right.
  - Some apps support swiping right to go back, but it’s not consistent.
- On Android, the global back button is on the bottom bar, on the left. 
  - Always accessible, no matter what app you’re in. It’s a great accessibility feature. 
  - It’s another one of those small design decisions that has a huge impact on usability.
- Apple's UX/UI innovation has been deteriorating for years...
  - I'm still trying to understand what's the difference in UX/UI between iPhone 12 & iPhone 6
- Gmail supports swiping right to go back, but they also support swiping right to delete emails and those are very different things
  - the browsers also support swiping...though I hate this...
