- ## 

- ## TIL the ISO standards aren't free. For some reason I thought this was open source.
- https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/1368811614233837571
  - It makes me wonder why they don't just use a license that allows them to be open source but still make money off of corporate usage. It seems like it would be beneficial for a standard to be open.
- Because just about anything that can have a price tag attached will, same as ‘certified organic’ and a load of other things that at first glance you’d think were ‘open’

- ## There are two kinds of developers:
- The ones who like to make things sound as complicated as possible so they can look smarter than the rest and feel better with themselves.
- The ones who try to simplify things to make them as easy as possible for others.

- ## Also sometimes the best solution is indeed just to take a walk or a nap and leave the problem alone.
  - A tired developer is not a productive one.

- ## Worry less about people disabling JavaScript for websites.
- Worry more about JavaScript disabling websites for people.

- ## Someone literally emailed me a death threat because they got the last letter from my course and I don’t have more content to send. 
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1364936558651076615
  - When the audience is large enough, there’s always going to be some percentage of people who are unstable and need help. 
  - It’s just numbers. Kind of scary to think about.
- Similar recent issue happened to the Curl maintainer
  - [I WILL SLAUGHTER YOU](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/02/19/i-will-slaughter-you/)

- ## I'm vibing with mono color, but maybe it's overdone.
- https://twitter.com/brian_lovin/status/1363388183153569793
  - I love the negative margins on the subscribe box to maintain a straight key line.
- I love it, but feels slightly less legible. 
  - I find the sweetspot is iA Writer Quattro, using it here
- Love the look. Much cleaner. Don't think it's overdone. 
  - Agree with some others - maybe mono for headings and something more legible for body text.

- ## Balance is both art and science.
- https://twitter.com/Jabronus/status/1362770841210126341
- Reminds me of this [Apple guideline](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/tab-bars/) for tab bar icons! 

- ## What’s the best investment you’ve ever made?
  - https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1362791801413799939
  - building my ideas
  - learning how to build and sell online

- ## My life has gotten better since making Code my default Git editor.
  - git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
  - git config --global -e

- ## TIL: LinkeDOM can replace JSDOM in Jest, with JSX behind the scene, and the result seems convincing

- ## friendly reminder: whenever somethings not working the *first* thing to do is `rm -rf node_modules` then reinstall dependencies

- ## JavaScript tip: You can wrap your `console.log()` arguments with curly brackets to see the variable names.

- ## I have to admit that "frameworkless" is a better buzzword than "framework agnostic", even if it’s *less* accurate.

- ## Starting to wonder if public school is even a good thing for my kids. 
- https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1352744738957316096
  - Each one who is being home schooled this year is already doing work in the next grade level in math. 
  - My 7th grader is doing high school math.
- I've been experiencing something similar with my 2nd grader.  We started homeschooling this year when we couldn't stand the zoom school anymore.  So far its been going really well.
- I’ve a theory: Public schools sucks for teachers and thats why it sucks for kids. .... but as always its much more diverse 

- ## Google is indexing some random person's copypaste of my blog first, and my actual blog isn't even on the first page.
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1351551717683453956
- Thanks to all for diagnosing! 
  - It seems like my website sends a 'noindex' header but I have no idea why. 
  - Maybe I messed up some setting, or the host has a bug. Contacted support.
- there is so much reposting going on. 
  - i think the fix is to aggressively use first person “I” a lot and link back to your own content in the text so its super obvious that its copied.

- ## I’m surprised that iOS still has the “back button” in the top left corner for most apps. 
- https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1351203275949940744
  - It’s the wrong spot for one-handed usage. 
  - It should be the opposite, in the lower right.
  - Some apps support swiping right to go back, but it’s not consistent.
- On Android, the global back button is on the bottom bar, on the left. 
  - Always accessible, no matter what app you’re in. It’s a great accessibility feature. 
  - It’s another one of those small design decisions that has a huge impact on usability.
- Apple's UX/UI innovation has been deteriorating for years...
  - I'm still trying to understand what's the difference in UX/UI between iPhone 12 & iPhone 6
- Gmail supports swiping right to go back, but they also support swiping right to delete emails and those are very different things
  - the browsers also support swiping...though I hate this...

- ## I don't know how I've managed to debug anything in NodeJS before NiM existed.
- https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1350801038270488579
  - `node --inspect-brk folder/file.js`

  - today I've fixed a Custom Elements rabbit hole coming from basicHTML in heresy-ssr
- With lots of console logs

- ## Which country has made the most successful use of the @Apple  and @Google COVID Contact Tracing APIs?
- https://twitter.com/mpjme/status/1348536712893489153
- The Estonian app HOIA (https://hoia.me/en/) is unobtrusive, easy to set up & overall p cool!
  - It is also fully open source and has been developed by a consortium of Estonian software companies completely free-of-charge
- Norther Ireland and the Republic of Ireland use it
