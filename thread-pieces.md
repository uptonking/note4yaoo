- ## JavaScript tip: You can wrap your `console.log()` arguments with curly brackets to see the variable names.

- ## I have to admit that "frameworkless" is a better buzzword than "framework agnostic", even if it’s *less* accurate.

- ## Starting to wonder if public school is even a good thing for my kids.

  - Each one who is being home schooled this year is already doing work in the next grade level in math. 
  - My 7th grader is doing high school math.
- I've been experiencing something similar with my 2nd grader.  We started homeschooling this year when we couldn't stand the zoom school anymore.  So far its been going really well.
- I’ve a theory: Public schools sucks for teachers and thats why it sucks for kids. .... but as always its much more diverse

- Thanks to all for diagnosing! 
  - It seems like my website sends a 'noindex' header but I have no idea why. 
  - Maybe I messed up some setting, or the host has a bug. Contacted support.
- there is so much reposting going on. 
  - i think the fix is to aggressively use first person “I” a lot and link back to your own content in the text so its super obvious that its copied.

- ## I’m surprised that iOS still has the “back button” in the top left corner for most apps.

  - It’s the wrong spot for one-handed usage. 
  - It should be the opposite, in the lower right.
  - Some apps support swiping right to go back, but it’s not consistent.
- On Android, the global back button is on the bottom bar, on the left. 
  - Always accessible, no matter what app you’re in. It’s a great accessibility feature. 
  - It’s another one of those small design decisions that has a huge impact on usability.
- Apple's UX/UI innovation has been deteriorating for years...
  - I'm still trying to understand what's the difference in UX/UI between iPhone 12 & iPhone 6
- Gmail supports swiping right to go back, but they also support swiping right to delete emails and those are very different things
  - the browsers also support swiping...though I hate this...

- ## I don't know how I've managed to debug anything in NodeJS before NiM existed.
- https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1350801038270488579
  - `node --inspect-brk folder/file.js`

  - today I've fixed a Custom Elements rabbit hole coming from basicHTML in heresy-ssr
- With lots of console logs
