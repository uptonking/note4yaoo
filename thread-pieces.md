- ## When you look at technology today, you probably group things into categories
- https://dev.to/triptych/observable-discovering-a-new-world-1egc
  - such as “Relevant to me” or “Not something I’ll ever use”. 
- However, there are things that you come across as “What is this?” or “What’s the big deal?” where you are unsure as to whether this new thing you are encountering will be a distraction or a possible new source of benefit to you.
  - You hear about things like blockchain, AI, Augmented Reality, and new languages like Rust or GO and you struggle to find a way to make it relevant to your day to day work.

- ## “The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it.” - Pamela Zave
- https://twitter.com/CodeWisdom/status/1438174531508658176
- Complexity kills software projects. It causes bugs. It hides bugs. It makes bugs hard to fix.
- There are two kinds. 
  - Complexity can be imposed from the outside by the problem to be solved.
  - Or it can originate from implementation details. 
  - Programmers must control the latter.
- One of the worst rookie mistakes is to attempt to control the former, often by hiding it behind an abstraction. 
- But the complexity doesn’t go away. 
- It ends up leaking out in unexpected places.

- ## poll: URL vs Url
- https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1434480148649177094
  - URL : Url  = 49.6% : 50.4%  /votes1401

- ## There's a gap between:
- https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1432728320429461508
  - what I know I should do
  - what I do in practice

- ## After suffering career burnout for the past 4-5 years, here's how I've come to understand its cause: 
- https://twitter.com/marcysutton/status/1292971874570256385
  - Burnout is a response to repeated attempts to make meaningful change while lacking the agency(力量、作用) to do so. 
  - See problems > try to fix them > get shot down or ignored.
- Mismatch between authority and responsibility like others said, but also feeling like your work is not personally meaningful or effective. See problems > try to fix them > welcome to outcome unclear research limbo land

- ## If you are on the verge of burning out and in a situation where you cannot take a break, slow down! 
- https://twitter.com/hey_yogini/status/1432204261647994886
  - Take one thing at a time and making sure to take out a small amount of time for yourself.  
  - I kept doing this and it worked!
- Slowing down, and getting back the energy is the best way to be productive in long run.
- Taking one thing at a time really works & actually gets everything done faster

- ## If you are on the verge of burning out and in a situation where you cannot take a break, slow down! 

Take one thing at a time and making sure to take out a small amount of time for yourself.  

I kept doing this and it worked!

- ## Whenever I watch a tutorial for anything, I'll spend at least the same amount of time afterwards trying to do something similar from scratch.
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1393259427491426305
  - I feel like this is critical for breaking free from "tutorial hell".
- If you're not familiar with the term, "tutorial hell" is the thing where you watch tutorial after tutorial, following along without issue, 
  - but never actually learning how to build stuff from scratch, on your own

- ## Recently I learned a new term: “productive failure”. 
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1393262281375555589
  - We learn more from struggling and failing to build something than we do from effortlessly completing it. 
  - As long as you know more at the end than you did at the start, it’s a success.

- ## I honestly think the main reason i'm so much happier in the last 12 months is getting off facebook. 
- https://twitter.com/stevage1/status/1428955323306414085
  - So much better not comparing your life against others on a daily basis. 
  - Or feeling the need to share highlights for reactions.

- ## [The web] is for everyone. Not just for everyone to consume, but for everyone to make
- https://twitter.com/midvintr/status/1423579315632066568

- ## As a software maintainer, how do you deal with questions from people who clearly don't have the basic skills to do what they are trying to do?
- https://twitter.com/MarijnJH/status/1423562136995905536
  - I don't want to be a jerk, but I also don't have time or energy to nudge all these people through the process of learning web dev.
- I usually guide them to better teachers. Not everyone is a good instructor!
- Try to stay away from those people as good as you can, else you could consider to create a FAQ and politely refer to it. I’ve noticed that the most unskilled procrastinators prefer to involve you in endless talks instead of doing a quick research in Google to find a documentation
- Thanks for getting in touch. Judging from the question you asked I should warn you that this project is not aimed for someone of your skill level. I'm not able to provide the tutoring necessary to bring you up to speed. Try looking into XYZ or hiring a more experienced developer.
- Great question. Next question!

- ## A senior developer is someone whose job is to be constantly interrupted and help people out
- https://twitter.com/qntm/status/1418612464300797957

- ## "Book smart" people always look for obscure, jargon-filled shortcuts to success.
- https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1388584008494239750
- Takes a long time to get it down to:
  - Learn by doing
  - Do what you said you would do
  - Do it longer than anyone else
  - Do stuff with peers and mentors
  - "Simple, not easy" over "Secret, and fast!"
- You can be "too smart"
  - You find it easy to fool people, including yourself.
  - What’s boring is often important — and the smartest people are the least interested in what’s boring.
  - Intelligence can make it difficult to communicate.

- ## My rule of thumb is to insist that a user story must contain only one event. Only one "when".
- https://twitter.com/alexbunardzic/status/1411368407048491009

- ## Drone photographer Lior Patel followed a herd of sheep for several months, as the herd was shepherded(护送，牧羊人) to its summer pasture(牧场，工作状况). Entrancing and relaxing.
- https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1408878326370930690
  - 一群绵羊的迁移

- ## SQLite 的作者 D. 理查德·希普，用到的所有工具都是自己写的
- https://twitter.com/ruanyf/status/1402439971542167556
  - 昨天发布了HTTP服务器软件Althttpd。SQLite官网就用它架设，整个软件只有一个C文件
  - 先写了数据库SQLite，接着写了Bug追踪系统 CVSTrac，然后写了版本管理系统Fossil，现在是 Web 服务器。

- ## One thing I've learned this week: some of the best engineering candidates have almost *zero* Twitter presence.
- https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1400266606723289088
  - They lurk, and they email you when you put up a job req in a tweet. But they don't tweet much themselves.
  - I could totally work w someone like that
- for sure, I know lots of people in that category because I know them personally from meetups and they just don't do much with twitter, but they're the ones I go to for most of my niche advice
- Building Twitter presence by using reinterpretations of the docs, motivational quotes and asking some arbitrary questions. The stench of opportunism is unbearable.
- Unpopular comment: in my experience they also tend to not evolve, and to keep reinventing the wheel. They are usually the “I have my framework” people.

- ## I take copious(大量的，丰富的) notes in meetings. I write a thorough automated tests.
- https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1399561004237967361
  - This gives people the impression that I'm organized (and maybe I am) but it doesn't say why.
  - Why is because I stand no chance to remember what I've done without these coping strategies.

- ## You can learn more building one autocomplete than building a whole website. Both ways are OK though.
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1395520718033534976

- ## When someone asks for something I “don’t have the time for”, I don’t say that. Because we all have 1, 440 minutes every day. 
- https://twitter.com/flybayer/status/1387535834614845442
  - Instead I politely decline so that “I can focus on the most important things”. 
  - And I also don’t apologize.
  - Saying “no” gives me the same feeling as marking a task Done
- Saying “I have no time.” is the socially less offensive choice, because it avoids saying “I want to spend my time on some other thing x, because that is more important than what you want from me”.

- ## you should review your priorities every single day

- ## Mozilla used Rust to build Stylo, the CSS engine in Firefox (replacing approximately 160, 000 lines of C++ with 85, 000 lines of Rust). 
- https://twitter.com/mozhacks/status/1386533367072579584
- I’m 100% convinced by rust and use it every day, but tbh lines of code are a terrible metric. One of the worst in fact.

- ## I don't view what I do as primarily self promotion but education, 
- https://twitter.com/RyanCarniato/status/1384650828997267458
  - but I definitely can understand how it can be seen that way as I'm passionate about all things reactive, and JS frameworks.
- I don't mind you saying Solid is fast (it is) or well designed, but writing articles as though you had done that work seems odd.

- ## If you have an idea for something that already exists
- https://twitter.com/tannerlinsley/status/1383201108508635138
  - and a passion to solve that problem better for yourself or even the tiniest subset of existing users, then you should probably give it a try.
  - You'll likely learn a ton about the problem space and at least validate your idea.
- I think it also depends on if you want to open source it or not. 
  - Even then, contributors will try to help you clean it up whether you want to or not

- ## Motivation doesn't last. Neither does inspiration.
- There are only two solutions to this problem:
  - We can capture those rare moments and use them to solve hard problems. 
  - Or we can focus on habits, which will minimize the mental effort to get the important things done.

- ## TIL Webpack v5.20.0 added `output.clean` to auto clean the output directory before emit

- ## Underrated way to learn something: try building a toy version of it. You both learn a little bit about the problem and get better at extracting the essence of something complex.
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1372395035342295042
- Like fre, it is a 2KB implementation of react.
- I started my JS journey by reverse engineering and building a toy version of jQuery. 
  - It inspired me to focus and prioritize designing intuitive + approachable APIs for others.

- ## I've noticed a recent trend of design system consumers tricking components that have required accessibility properties by providing empty strings.
- https://twitter.com/JossMackison/status/1372058993380651009
  - Drastic times call for drastic measures.

- ## ProTip! Velcro your external drives to the back of your laptop to stay portable and keeping them safe
- https://twitter.com/samuelkraft/status/1370082404984090624

- ## Always choose a job that you gonna learn the most

- ## If you're looking for a mentor, DMing your favorite open source personality isn't the way to go.
- https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/1369022399967096838
  - Look local: You may already have mentors. Most of what I've learned, I taught myself, or I learned from random peers (junior and senior) over YEARS -- not some single "Sensei" type.
  - It sounds stupid, but sometimes the best mentor you can have is *yourself*. Learn how to teach yourself things, and when you do work with another peer you're learning from (a "mentor"), you'll get a LOT more out of the experience, and so will they.
  - I'm not disparaging mentorship. It can be great, I just think people might have the wrong idea of what it has to look like, and how they need it to work.
- But *sometimes* it is... or at least can be.

- ## TIL the ISO standards aren't free. For some reason I thought this was open source.
- https://twitter.com/BenLesh/status/1368811614233837571
  - It makes me wonder why they don't just use a license that allows them to be open source but still make money off of corporate usage. It seems like it would be beneficial for a standard to be open.
- Because just about anything that can have a price tag attached will, same as ‘certified organic’ and a load of other things that at first glance you’d think were ‘open’

- ## There are two kinds of developers:
- The ones who like to make things sound as complicated as possible so they can look smarter than the rest and feel better with themselves.
- The ones who try to simplify things to make them as easy as possible for others.

- ## Also sometimes the best solution is indeed just to take a walk or a nap and leave the problem alone.
  - A tired developer is not a productive one.

- ## Worry less about people disabling JavaScript for websites.
- Worry more about JavaScript disabling websites for people.

- ## Someone literally emailed me a death threat because they got the last letter from my course and I don’t have more content to send. 
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1364936558651076615
  - When the audience is large enough, there’s always going to be some percentage of people who are unstable and need help. 
  - It’s just numbers. Kind of scary to think about.
- Similar recent issue happened to the Curl maintainer
  - [I WILL SLAUGHTER YOU](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/02/19/i-will-slaughter-you/)

- ## I'm vibing with mono color, but maybe it's overdone.
- https://twitter.com/brian_lovin/status/1363388183153569793
  - I love the negative margins on the subscribe box to maintain a straight key line.
- I love it, but feels slightly less legible. 
  - I find the sweetspot is iA Writer Quattro, using it here
- Love the look. Much cleaner. Don't think it's overdone. 
  - Agree with some others - maybe mono for headings and something more legible for body text.

- ## Balance is both art and science.
- https://twitter.com/Jabronus/status/1362770841210126341
- Reminds me of this [Apple guideline](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/tab-bars/) for tab bar icons! 

- ## What’s the best investment you’ve ever made?
  - https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1362791801413799939
  - building my ideas
  - learning how to build and sell online

- ## My life has gotten better since making Code my default Git editor.
  - git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
  - git config --global -e

- ## TIL: LinkeDOM can replace JSDOM in Jest, with JSX behind the scene, and the result seems convincing

- ## friendly reminder: whenever somethings not working the *first* thing to do is `rm -rf node_modules` then reinstall dependencies

- ## JavaScript tip: You can wrap your `console.log()` arguments with curly brackets to see the variable names.

- ## I have to admit that "frameworkless" is a better buzzword than "framework agnostic", even if it’s *less* accurate.

- ## Starting to wonder if public school is even a good thing for my kids. 
- https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1352744738957316096
  - Each one who is being home schooled this year is already doing work in the next grade level in math. 
  - My 7th grader is doing high school math.
- I've been experiencing something similar with my 2nd grader.  We started homeschooling this year when we couldn't stand the zoom school anymore.  So far its been going really well.
- I’ve a theory: Public schools sucks for teachers and thats why it sucks for kids. .... but as always its much more diverse 

- ## Google is indexing some random person's copypaste of my blog first, and my actual blog isn't even on the first page.
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1351551717683453956
- Thanks to all for diagnosing! 
  - It seems like my website sends a 'noindex' header but I have no idea why. 
  - Maybe I messed up some setting, or the host has a bug. Contacted support.
- there is so much reposting going on. 
  - i think the fix is to aggressively use first person “I” a lot and link back to your own content in the text so its super obvious that its copied.

- ## I’m surprised that iOS still has the “back button” in the top left corner for most apps. 
- https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1351203275949940744
  - It’s the wrong spot for one-handed usage. 
  - It should be the opposite, in the lower right.
  - Some apps support swiping right to go back, but it’s not consistent.
- On Android, the global back button is on the bottom bar, on the left. 
  - Always accessible, no matter what app you’re in. It’s a great accessibility feature. 
  - It’s another one of those small design decisions that has a huge impact on usability.
- Apple's UX/UI innovation has been deteriorating for years...
  - I'm still trying to understand what's the difference in UX/UI between iPhone 12 & iPhone 6
- Gmail supports swiping right to go back, but they also support swiping right to delete emails and those are very different things
  - the browsers also support swiping...though I hate this...

- ## I don't know how I've managed to debug anything in NodeJS before NiM existed.
- https://twitter.com/WebReflection/status/1350801038270488579
  - `node --inspect-brk folder/file.js`

  - today I've fixed a Custom Elements rabbit hole coming from basicHTML in heresy-ssr
- With lots of console logs

- ## Which country has made the most successful use of the @Apple  and @Google COVID Contact Tracing APIs?
- https://twitter.com/mpjme/status/1348536712893489153
- The Estonian app HOIA (https://hoia.me/en/) is unobtrusive, easy to set up & overall p cool!
  - It is also fully open source and has been developed by a consortium of Estonian software companies completely free-of-charge
- Norther Ireland and the Republic of Ireland use it
