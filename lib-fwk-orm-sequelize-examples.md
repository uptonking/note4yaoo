- https://github.com/overlookmotel/sequelize-hierarchy /js/201906/inactive
  - Relational databases aren't very good at dealing with nested hierarchies like **folders/categories/Tree**
  - To store a hierarchy in a database, the usual method is to give each record a `ParentID` field which says which is the record one level above it.
  - if you want to retrieve an entire tree/hierarchy structure from the database, it requires multiple queries, recursively getting each level of the hierarchy. 
    - For a big tree structure, this is a lengthy process, and annoying to code.
    - This plugin for Sequelize solves this problem.
  - Requires Sequelize v2.x.x, v3.x.x, v4.x.x or v5.x.x.
  - [Add initial support for Sequelize V6](https://github.com/overlookmotel/sequelize-hierarchy/pull/223)

- https://github.com/grantcarthew/node-mppg /js/inactive
  - The Materialized Paths pattern is a simple method to store tree or hierarchical data into a flat data store. 
  - It stores each tree node as a row in a table. 
  - Each row stores the identifiers of the node’s ancestors or path as a string.
  - The pattern also provides more flexibility in working with the path, such as finding nodes by partial paths.

  - This project provides a Momento-backed read-aside caching implementation for sequelize. 
  - The goal is to provide an interface for caching sequelize queries.
  - You can use Momento as your caching engine for any relational databases that are a part of sequelize's dialects.
  - To use this library, you will need a Momento API key. 
# ddd/cqrs

- https://github.com/sugarandmagic/sequelize-mv-support /MIT/ts
  - This package adds support for Views and Materialized Views in Sequelize.
  - We're heavy users of views and materialized views, but we use Sequelize a lot for bootstrapping and testing database schema. 
  - this module adds support for both views and materialized views to Sequelize, as well as properly exporting typescript declarations.
  - All the original Sequelize methods and options still work with this module

- https://github.com/s4nt14go/white-label /202312/ts
  - Serverless Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with unit tests
  - This project exemplifies a CreateUser use case and how we can trigger an event, signaling we have a new user onboard.
  - DBs: PostgreSQL CockroachDB Serverless and DynamoDB
  - ORM: Sequelize
  - AWS services: Lambda, AppSync, Systems Manager Parameter Store
  - I started this project using Khalil Stemmler's white-label users module and applied some concepts based on Vladimir Khorikov courses where he tackles DDD in a great way.

- https://github.com/QuaNode/beamjs /js
  - Enterprise full stack web development framework (Backend-JS - ExpressJS - AngularJS - MongoDB)
  - BeamJS is built above Backend-JS to provide data controllers for SQL and No-SQL databases. It also includes file system controllers that work on a local file system or cloud storage.
  - These data controllers are abstract adapters above ODM/ORM patterns of MongooseJS and SequelizeJS. These data controllers are abstract adapters above ODM/ORM patterns of MongooseJS and SequelizeJS.
  - supports CQRS architecture through mixed model definitions over different DBs.
  - supports Horizontal/DB multi-tenancy by automatically handling multi-DB connection mapping.
  - https://github.com/quaNode/Backend-JS /js
    - a layer built above expressjs and socket.io to enable behaviours framework for nodejs applications.

  - Sequelize is used to define mappings between models and database tables

- https://github.com/rezeus/kernel /js/inactive
  - Kernel for event-driven applications.
  - Asynchronous event is a regular event whose listener returns a Promise.

- https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor /MIT/js/inactive
  - Flux architecture for the backend. Realtime data and time travel capabilities included.
  - Works like Redux. Dispatch events to change database data
  - Events are persisted, thus tracking the database's history
  - Pushing realtime data becomes trivial, since you can subscribe to the store for updates
  - **Isomorphic reducers - Share code between back end and front end**
  - Middleware concept, compatible with Redux middleware
  - No lock-in: Ability to opt-out any time and just use the underlying database directly
  - Finer-grained access control - Control write access by event type, not only by table
  - Works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite & MSSQL using Sequelize right now
  - It is related to CQRS, but no traditional CQRS. Rather something between common CRUD and traditional CQRS.
  - Differences to Redux
    - Reducer's signature is `(collection, event) => changeset` instead of `(state, action) => state`. The `action` and the `event` are just synonyms.The real difference is that the flux capacitor reducers take a database collection and return a changeset (a set of database operations).
    - This is necessary, since we usually cannot hold the complete database in memory as opposed to Redux' state.
  - Differences to traditional CQRS
    - No distributed system by default, but just one data storage service (can be easily turned into a cluster, though)
    - No aggregates, just one read model to check business rules when handling an event
    - Depends on database transactions to ensure data consistency
# server-sent event

# testing
- https://github.com/omvmike/fake-entity-service /202401/ts
  - Library to simplify database data generation for testing purposes
  - aim is simplify database data generation for integration and end-to-end tests.
  - the main goal is to make it ORM agnostic. At the moment the library supports Sequelize ORM and TypeORM.
  - Target framework is NestJs but the code is framework agnostic 
  - The library was tested with Jest but it should work with any other test runner.
  - This library is inspired by Laravel's factory so you can find some similarities. But since it's a TypeScript library, it has quite different syntax.
