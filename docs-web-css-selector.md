# [pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements)

``` CSS
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```

- pseudo-elements can be used to style a specific part of an element.
- a pseudo-element selector applies styles to parts of your document content in scenarios where there isn't a specific HTML element to select.
- A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). 
- You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector. 
  - It must appear after the simple selectors in the statement.

- 伪元素常用
- `::after/before/first-letter/first-line/marker/part/selection/...`

# [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)

``` CSS
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

- pseudo-classes can be used to style an element based on its state.
- a pseudo-class selector targets elements depending on their state rather than on information from the document tree.
- A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). 
- Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like 
  - the history of the navigator (:visited, for example), 
  - the status of its content (like :checked on certain form elements), 
  - or the position of the mouse (like :hover)

  - Linguistic pseudo-classes
    - :lang/dir
  - Location pseudo-classes
    - :visited/link/target/scope
  - User action pseudo-classes
    - :hover/active/focus
  - Time-dimensional pseudo-classes
    - :current/past/future
  - Resource state pseudo-classes

  - The input pseudo-classes
    - :enabled/disabled/read-only/read-write/placeholder-shown
    - :default/checked/interminate/blank/valid/invalid
    - :in-range/out-of-range/required/optional/user-invalid
  - Tree-structural pseudo-classes
    - :root/empty/nth-child/first-child/only-child/nth-of-type

- Like regular classes, you can chain together as many pseudo-classes as you want in a selector.

# `:first-of-type` pseudo-class 

- represents the first element of its type among a group of sibling elements.
- `article :first-of-type { background-color: pink; }`
- `article *:first-of-type { background-color: pink; }`
  - This example shows how nested elements can also be targeted. 
  - Note that the universal selector ( `*` ) is implied when no simple selector is written.
  - 会修改所有不同类型元素的第一个元素的样式

# `::before` pseudo-elements

- In CSS,  `::before` creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. 
- It is often used to add cosmetic(表面的) content to an element with the `content` property. 
- **It is inline by default**.
- The pseudo-elements generated by `::before` and `::after` are contained by the element's formatting box, and thus don't apply to replaced elements such as `<img>` , or to `<br>` elements.

# `:nth-child()`

- The `:nth-child()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.

``` CSS
/* Selects the second <li> element in a list */
li:nth-child(2) {
  color: lime;
}

/* Selects every fourth element among any group of siblings */
:nth-child(4n) {
  color: lime;
}

/* select the odd rows of an HTML table: 1, 3, 5, etc.*/
tr:nth-child(odd) or tr:nth-child(2n+1)
```
