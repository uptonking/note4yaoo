# docs-web-css-selector

## `::before` pseudo-elements

- In CSS, `::before` creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. 
- It is often used to add cosmetic(表面的) content to an element with the `content` property. 
- **It is inline by default**.
- The pseudo-elements generated by `::before` and `::after` are contained by the element's formatting box, and thus don't apply to replaced elements such as `<img>` , or to `<br>` elements.

## `:nth-child()`

- The `:nth-child()` CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.

``` CSS
/* Selects the second <li> element in a list */
li:nth-child(2) {
  color: lime;
}

/* Selects every fourth element among any group of siblings */
:nth-child(4n) {
  color: lime;
}

/* select the odd rows of an HTML table: 1, 3, 5, etc.*/
tr:nth-child(odd) or tr:nth-child(2n+1)
```
