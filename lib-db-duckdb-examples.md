    - Run SQL queries directly in your desktop or mobile browser.

  - An Extensible Framework for Linking Databases and Interactive Views
  - Visualize, select, and filter datasets with millions or billions of records.
  - Mosaic pushes computation to DuckDB, both server-side and in your browser via WebAssembly.
  - Build data-driven web apps, or interact with data directly in Jupyter notebooks.
  - The key idea is to have interface components "publish" their data needs as declarative queries that can be managed, optimized, and cross-filtered by a coordinator that proxies access to DuckDB.

  - https://github.com/antonycourtney/tad
  - Tad desktop application enables you to quickly view and explore tabular data in several of the most popular tabular data file formats: CSV, Parquet, and SQLite and DuckDb database files. 
  - 依赖aggtree、reltab
  - Internally, the application is powered by an in-memory instance of `DuckDb`, a fast, embeddable database engine optimized for analytic queries.
  - The core of Tad is a React UI component that implements a hierarchical pivot table that allows you to specify a combination of pivot, filter, aggregate, sort, column selection
  - Tad uses `SlickGrid` for rendering the data grid. 
  - Tad was initially released in 2017 as a standalone desktop application for viewing and exploring CSV files.
  - reltab
    - The core abstraction used in Tad for programmatically constructing and executing relational SQL queries.
    - This also defines the driver interface implemented by specific database back-ends, and a small, transport-agnostic remoting layer to allow queries and results to be transmitted between a web browser (or electron renderer process) and a reltab backend server.

  - DuckDB-Wasm brings DuckDB to every browser thanks to WebAssembly.
  - Duckdb-Wasm speaks Arrow fluently, reads Parquet, CSV and JSON files backed by Filesystem APIs or HTTP requests

  - WhatTheDuck is an open-source web application built on DuckDB. 
  - It allows users to upload CSV files, store them in tables, and perform SQL queries on the data.

# utils

# duckdb-powered
- https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis /MIT/202409/ts
  - https://nshiab.github.io/simple-data-analysis/
  - Easy-to-use and high-performance JavaScript library for data analysis. Works with tabular and geospatial data.
  - The library is based on DuckDB, a fast in-process analytical database.
    - Under the hood, SDA sends SQL queries to be executed by DuckDB. 
    - We use duckdb-node and duckdb-wasm. 
    - SDA can run in the browser and with Node.js and other runtimes.
    - For geospatial computations, we rely on the duckdb_spatial extension.
  - The syntax and the available methods were inspired by Pandas (Python) and the Tidyverse (R).
  - The library is maintained by Nael Shiab, computational journalist and senior data producer for CBC News.
  - SDA is born out of the frustration of switching between Python, R, and JavaScript to produce data journalism projects
