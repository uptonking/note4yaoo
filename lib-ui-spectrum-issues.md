- ## [How to set text's color?](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues/864)
- We haven't finished implementing the typography components in React Spectrum just yet. 
  - The current text components are mainly used as part of another component that provides the styling for it, e.g. menu items, illustrated message, dialog, etc. 
  - We will eventually have various predefined typography styles. Should be coming relatively soon.
- For now, the best I can suggest is to use either one of the existing components that styles `<Text>` for you, or use an element like `<span>` with custom CSS.
