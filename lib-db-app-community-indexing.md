- ## Multi tenancy is paramount for vector indexes
- https://twitter.com/Sirupsen/status/1730356136782549153
  - With b-trees’ log(n) it doesn’t matter too much if you have one big table for all tenants
  - For a vector index, the complexity is higher. Important to use the natural sharding keys when you can

- ## 💡 Database Indexing Explained.
- https://twitter.com/NikkiSiapno/status/1719352895169265797
  - An index is a key-value pair where the key is used to search for data instead of the corresponding indexed column(s), and the value is a pointer to the relevant row(s) in the table.
  - Indexing speeds up queries, but it also takes up storage space and adds overhead to operations
  - B-tree is one of the most commonly used indexing structures where keys are hierarchically sorted. B-tree is most commonly used because of its efficiency in storing and searching through ordered data. Their balanced structure means that all keys can be accessed in the same number of steps, making performance consistent.
  - Hash indexes are best used when you are searching for an exact value match. The key component of a hash index is the hash function. 
  - Bitmap indexing is used for columns with few unique values. 
  - A composite index may be used when multiple columns are often used in a WHERE clause together.

- If you want to see a dumb example of how you can implement indexing on top of a SQL database without it, I wrote a tutorial on implementing basic indexes as part of a series on making a SQL database from scratch.

- ## [sql server - Will index be fully loaded into memory_201011](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4296027/will-index-be-fully-loaded-into-memory)
- No, it's treated like any other data stored on disk. It's loaded into memory disk page by disk page. And a page stays in memory as long as it's regularly accessed.

- The answer to this is in several parts:
  - The size of the index.
  - What parts are accessed.
  - Memory pressure.
- SQL Server cached the index in memory as it was being read.
  - However, if I had put other memory pressure on SQL Server, it would have dropped out those cached index pages by order of lowest reads.

- ## [联合主键和复合主键和联合索引](https://www.cnblogs.com/saoge/p/14431536.html)
- 复合主键 就是指你表的主键含有一个以上的字段组成
- 联合主键 就是多个主键联合形成一个主键组合，联合就在于主键A跟主键B形成的联合主键是唯一的。

- [提问关于 mysql得联合主键和复合主键的问题 - SegmentFault 思否](https://segmentfault.com/q/1010000021884619)
  - 在英文语境中只有 Composite Primary Key（也有叫 Compound Primary Key 的），就是一个表中如果是多个字段组成一个主键，那么这个主键就被称为这玩意儿。
  - 这种概念是中文编程界（或者说是中文编程博客界）人为造出的。
  - 上面的例子看看就得了，根本就是胡编一个 联合主键 的定义出来，你会发现它其实就是一个最简单的自增主键，只不过表的逻辑上 student_id + subject_id 是唯一的，id 就成了所谓的二者的 联合主键。
