  - A Community-led Hyper-Hackable Text Editor, Forked from Atom, built on Electron.
  - Designed to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.
  - [Porting Teletype from Atom repo a.k.a Collaboration tool_202305](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/issues/536)
    - The main issue is that Teletype runs on a server and we simply might not be able to justify running such a service without charging a maintenance cost for access.
