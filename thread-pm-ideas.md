- ## 

- ## I'm happy to announce, that basetools.io is in beta! 
- https://twitter.com/sebastianhoitz/status/1369390750404927490
  - It is a paywall for your Github repository or npm package. 
  - Just connect to GitHub, set a price, and charge for access to your repository.
- You can think of it as Gumroad but specifically targeting developers selling their UI components, frameworks, starter templates, or libraries.
  - I think there are huge opportunities for developers to sell their projects and earn a living this way. Lots of exciting projects getting started, too. 
  - People like @adamwathan or @mxstbr are leading the way. I'm sure there is going to be plenty more.
  - I want to support developers with basetools.io by basically taking care of a lot of the barriers to this: Charging money, making sure it has the correct taxes, writing invoices, granting access only to people that paid â€“ This is what we do.
- This could go really well or really, really bad. 
  - Hopefully it doesn't turn into a situation like the Unity Asset Store where folks reskin libraries simply looking to profit. 
  - There could be an explosion of low quality libraries that only serve to add confusion.
- What's the difference between this and GumHub by @m1guelpf ?
  - Sell access to your GitHub repos with Gumroad
