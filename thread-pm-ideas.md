- Just a note that https://tweetcyborg.com converts a tweet to a simple image for you. 
  - No idea if this is the best service to do it, but it works
- What about inlining a copy of the tweet, with minimum styles, like I did here for example?
  - Iâ€™m using this plugin for @eleven_ty , if it can be an inspiration
- I've found exactly the same thing. 
  - Twitter's embedding is very inefficient. 
  - I'm still trying to find something which will turn it into an image + alt text + link automagically.
