- ## ¬©Ô∏è [Crowdfunding Joplin Server license? - Lounge - Joplin Forum _202108](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/crowdfunding-joplin-server-license/19891?page=2)
- the Joplin Server license is different from the rest of the project - it's a "Free for Personal Use Only" license and it disallows commercial use.

- ## ¬©Ô∏è [RFC: Switch to AGPL license for Joplin Server? - Development - Joplin Forum _202104](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/rfc-switch-to-agpl-license-for-joplin-server/16529)
  - The idea is to prevent a company from taking the software, improve it and sell it as a service, without contributing anything back to the original project. It's still however possible to self-host the service and I suppose even modify it, as long as it's not for commercial purposes.
  - I think I will switch to that license for Joplin Server
  - For now, the desktop, mobile and CLI apps will remain MIT.

- ## üöÄ [Joplin Server pre-release is now available - Development - Joplin Forum _202101](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/joplin-server-pre-release-is-now-available/13605)
- The first release of Joplin Server is now available as a pre-release
  - You will need Joplin v1.6+ clients
  - At this point, this server allows you to sync any Joplin client with it, as you would do with Dropbox, OneDrive, etc. So in that way, it's not essential. 
  - Long term, the goal is to add collaboration features

- ## [Options/Configuration should show storage location_201711](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/7)
- where the files are located
  - On Windows: `C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\.config\joplin-deskop` .
  - On macOS and Linux: `~/.config/joplin-desktop` . /home/yaoo/.config/joplindev-desktop/database.sqlite
  - For the terminal app, it's under the directory "joplin" instead of "joplin-deskop"

- ## üÜöÔ∏è [What do you do differently in Joplin in comparison to other note taking apps? - Lounge - Joplin Forum _202004](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/what-do-you-do-differently-in-joplin-in-comparison-to-other-note-taking-apps/7886?page=3)
- I have been using BoostNote, then boostnote.next for a few years. Now the legacy is discontinued, and the .next version is pushing heavily and constantly for paid cloud storage, I have been looking for alternatives.
- Joplin seems to have much of it:
  - tree-like organization which can be re-arranged simply
  - export of entire tree structure
  - keyboard oriented workflow
  - actual support for dropbox through integration instead of working on file level
  - android support
- There are some things I will miss dealry on the way out:
  - Adinmotion markdown (for "NOTE", "WARNING" etc sections
  - better themes

- I use typora as an external Editor on Mac and Win10 Works like a charm and has a mix of layouted text and Tags that appear when you need to see them.

- Evernote has some cool things such as thumbnails in the note list but, to me, that is a kind of ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù feature that I can live without.
