# examples
- https://github.com/skovy/llm-markdown /MIT/202309/ts/inactive
  - https://llm-markdown.vercel.app/
  - A Nextjs app demonstrating how to display rich-text responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) by prompting and rendering Markdown formatting, Mermaid diagrams, and LaTeX equations.
# utils

# integrations
- https://github.com/apache/echarts-from-mermaid /202503/ts/inactive
  - A plugin that enables Apache ECharts to render charts using Mermaid-like syntax.
  - This plugin is particularly useful when you want to generate charts from text/markdown, especially in LLM applications. 
    - Instead of having LLMs generate complex ECharts options directly, you can use this plugin to convert simpler Mermaid-like syntax into ECharts options. 
    - This approach is more reliable since Mermaid syntax is much simpler than ECharts' option structure.
