- ## ðŸ““ðŸŽ¯ [Typora 1.0 | Hacker News _202111](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29360720)
- Document editing is only a part of maintaining a system of notes and there are so many competitors in this market compared to just a few years ago. And with Obsidian soon to release their live preview I don't know how competitive Typora with such a small feature set.
- Typora is a markdown reader/writer not a note taking or knowledge base application. It's strange for you to compare them like that.

- Typora is bad. It avoid the GPLv2+ from pandoc by writing their own HTML writer and the menu has additional export options that requires the user to install pandoc to be functional. It would have been much better if it is GPL and contribute back to pandoc in the first place 

- I love using Typora. My favorite feature is the mathjax support. It has replaced latex for me for grad school assignments and saves a lot of time.

- ## ðŸ““ [Zettlr â€“ FOSS markdown editor for personal knowledge management and publishing | Hacker News _202007](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23723775)
- I've just been using Google Docs. It's simple, searchable, and I can read/edit my notes while sitting on the can.

- If anybody is sad about Zettlr not having the graph view of like the one in Obsidian or RoamResearch, please be patient. A PR is already open for it.
- Does anybody find that graph view (like in Obsidian) useful? I play around with it for a while, but I don't really find it useful for any particular thing. Also overtime that graph grows too big to be visually easy to see patterns etc.
  - Sometimes it's an alternative to search. If you don't know exactly what to search for but remember generally what it's related to, you can zoom in to nodes you know are somewhat related and find something you're looking for that way. I can't say it's something I do every day but it's come in handy.
  - The graph view in Obsidian would become particularly powerful if you could progressively filter brightness of items based on a search term. Or, for example, if you could make matching items brighter based on clicking / typing a tag name.
  - I've mainly found it to be inspirational when working creatively, especially when I'm writing a 'dirty first draft' of something, e.g. a research embryo, collecting interviews about a subject, doing brainstorming sessions, even book reviews. I've still got to come to grips with segmenting Obsidian vaults so that the cloud doesn't grow too far...

- The drawback to working directly on Markdown files is that it's hard to synchronize your notes from/to mobile.

- ## [Marktext â€“ Elegant Markdown Editor for Linux, macOS, Windows | Hacker News _202112](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29687061)
- To the best of my knowledge this (Marktext) is the only free/open-source Markdown editor that has WYSIWYG like Typora
  - Obsidian very recently added this too, and it works great.
  - Another free and open source note taking app with WYSIWYG is TagSpaces 
  - Jupyter notebooks does it the way I prefer the most.l: It renders italics, bolds headings and whatnot as you edit but keeps showing the tags.

- I recommend something like Obsidian instead which is a markdown editor (newly upgraded) along with an entire knowledge base and note taking system that can create and maintain references across files.

- Things I want in a markdown editor: Grammar check. Auto-capitalise start of sentence and known proper nouns. Auto fix obvious typos without bothering me. Grammatically smart spellcheck. Detect and flag accidental double space. Detect and flag duplicate words. Word count excluding headlines. It's nice when I use Google docs and it has that stuff. I wish I had it in markdown.

- ## [Mark Text: Simple and Elegant Markdown Editor Focused on Speed and Usability | Hacker News _201911](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21462832)
- it directly renders the Markdown (in the editor itself, not in a separate pane or window), giving a WYSIWYG feel while still being backed by a plain-text (markdown)
  - Iâ€™ve tried Bear, Ulysses, IA writer, and countless others. None have this clever blended preview like Typora.
