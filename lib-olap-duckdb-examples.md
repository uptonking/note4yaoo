  - Internally, the application is powered by an in-memory instance of `DuckDb`, a fast, embeddable database engine optimized for analytic queries.
  - The core of Tad is a React UI component that implements a hierarchical pivot table that allows you to specify a combination of pivot, filter, aggregate, sort, column selection
  - Tad uses `SlickGrid` for rendering the data grid. 
  - Tad was initially released in 2017 as a standalone desktop application for viewing and exploring CSV files.
  - reltab
    - The core abstraction used in Tad for programmatically constructing and executing relational SQL queries.
