- ## [SSD Filesystem: XFS vs F2FS vs Btrfs vs Bcachefs vs ext4 : r/linuxquestions _202305](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/13usxg9/ssd_filesystem_xfs_vs_f2fs_vs_btrfs_vs_bcachefs/)
- AFAIK the dedicated flash FSs like F2FS are meant for devices where the FS has direct control over the physical sectors. On drives that present virtual sectors to the OS and control the physical sectors themselves in firmware (wear leveling) flash filesystems have no effect. That should probably be every SATA or NVME SSD.
- Btrfs only if you actually want to use the features like snapshots / subvolumes, copying files with reflinks (CoW), deduplication, transparent compression, data checksums and so on.
- Bcachefs isn't in the mainline kernel and if you have to ask this question I would strongly advise against using FSs that are not mainline.
- XFS and ext4 aren't that different. XFS has a few features that ext4 has not like CoW but it can't be shrinked while ext4 can. They perform differently for some specific workloads like creating or deleting tenthousands of files/folders. But none of these will be relevant to a bog standard use case like "browsing the internet and sometimes playing games like Minecraft".

- TL; DR: Just use the default of your chosen distro.

- ## 🆚️ [EXT4, BTRFS or XFS? : r/linuxquestions _202310](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/178fxcl/ext4_btrfs_or_xfs/)
  - Which filesystem is more appropriate for a NVME SSD?

- I've used ext4, XFS, Btrfs, and ZFS for gaming at different points. 
  - While the "next-gen" features of `Btrfs` are awesome, it tends to be slower. 
  - Of the other two, I tend to prefer `ext4`, as 🌹 XFS tends to perform better with large sets of data, but it's a smaller difference than with Btrfs.
- Another point for `ext4` is you can resize partitions both ways, whereas `XFS` can only be grown. For 99% of people, this doesn't really matter. 
  - I run some servers and like to be able to shrink partitions if needed, so I tend toward ext4, just in case. 
  - ⤴️ ext4 can also be "upgraded" to Btrfs, so if you wanted to, you could change to it.
- I actually prefer ZFS for performance, though. Basically Btrfs but better in every way (mostly because everything works, Btrfs is still a work in progress). ZFS typically benchmarks very well, so long as you have enough system resources. It isn't straightforward to setup under Linux, either. So, it's conditional.

- One downside of ext4 is fixed number of inodes, not sure if Fedora creates by default with inode64 flag, but lots of newcomers get caught on that and get completely lost when the system refuses to do some io operations while it still has available disk space.

- the only thing about zfs that inferior to btrfs is adding disks to a pool
  - I feel that this is more of feature than downside. I heard that they are working on it, but, it is extremely difficult to do preserving all safety and robustness. Personally I do not think that this is even worth the effort. Also, you can add disks to pool. Just not in a random way.

- I don't like that you cannot easily shrink `xfs` but it's still my goto.

- I like BTRFS for the snapshots feature which allows you to rollback if you have an upgrade that causes problems. I typically use that on my root partition. But I'm a huge fan of XFS for my drives that contain my media (music, videos and pictures) because it's fast, is super stable, has great performance and can handle large files with ease.
  - Yep, same here. My root is BTRFS for the snapshot feature, and everything else is XFS.

- Btrfs has copy-on-write (if you copy a 1GB file from Downloads to Documents, total storage used is 1GB not 2GB; it re-uses the old file).
  - So does XFS.

- If you're just a regular user then go for ext4. It's the most common for desktop users and it's reliable as hell. 
  - BTRFS has some nice features but it MAY be slightly more unreliable than ext4 and you have to set things up which can be annoying, even for an intermediate user. 
  - I don't have experience with XFS but I believe Red Hat and other enterprise distros use it due to it's scaling capabilities... so probably not that relevant to you.

- TLDR: For desktop ext4 or xfs - both are amazing file systems. Keep away from btrfs and zfs, unless you are building storage solutions. 
  - I, personally, and very subjectively, prefer xfs. All my servers and VMs, except the NAS are on xfs.
- BTRFS: Used to be a huge fun of this FS. But I ate too much shit with it . Maybe it has improved since 4 years ago, but I really doubt.
  - I did not find it stable enough even just as an fs for a developers desktop/laptop. As soon as you start use the fancy-pants features, expect weirdness. E.g. suddenly linux kernel build freezes on a too long write god knows why. The more snapshot's you have the more wired it behaves. And if you add compression to that - it just a matter of time before the whole FS goes bad. And the performance is abysmal.
- ZFS: great for industrial storage systems, iff you tune it right. Also you need to be absolutely sure that you always have at least 10% (better 20% really) free.

- You should use btrfs to hugely save space and have amazing backup features. It can even roll back up to whatever time if you have the snapshot

- XFS have lowest write amplification, so it is pretty good for SSD and in general. 
  - EXT4 is good because it is default choice. And low write amplification as well. 
  - BTRFS - no good, use only if you need it features. Outside some RAID configuration I will not use it personally.
- 🧐 No way am I using BTRFS for production RAID setup when even the project itself tells you not to use the RAID function for production.
  - For production RAID, ZFS is 1000 times more battle-tested for reliability. The problem is presumably bad enough that RedHat decided to abandon BTRFS
- I always thought that this only applies to "RAID5" configuration.

- If you have 32 but apps, don’t use XFS, or add the inode32 option. I learned about that feature when on our build server builds were failing due to missing directories….

- I would recommend btrfs if you use its features such as snapshots, subvolumes, compression etc. Otherwise, I would recommend ext4.

- The distro default. Right now for Fedora it is Btrfs, for Ubuntu and most other popular distros, it is ext4.

- 💡 I should have said BTRFS was developed to work with SSDs from the start. Whereas EXT4 was updated to work with SSDs

- EXT4:
  + Works well for most use cases
  + No maintenance required
  + support grow and shrink
  + can be "upgraded" to Btrfs
  - No extra feature (COW, checksum, ...)

- XFS:
  + Works well for most use cases
  + No maintenance required
  + perform better with large data
  + Supports COW and checksum (but only on metadata)
  + good for SSD
  - support grow, not shrink
  ~ Supports kind of snapshots using reflinks

- BTRFS:
  + Basic use works well for most use cases
  + Supports tons of features (COW, snapshots, checksum, raid options, ...)
  + good for SSD
  + not good for raid
  - Maintenance required (srub, defrag, balance)
  - unstable: Basic use is battle-tested, but specific options can lead to troubles

- ZFS:
  + Supports tons of features (COW, snapshots, checksum, raid options, ...)
  + Can be most performant (though margin is bigger on spinning drives than SSDs)
  - (GPL licensing issues)
  - Usually requires tons of resources (CPU/RAM)
  - Not well integrated in Linux (e.g. reflink does not work, you'll need auto dedup to be enabled to achieve something similar, which comes with a cost of resources/performance)
  - Complex to setup properly, complex to "upgrade" (add disk to a pool)

- This is not exhaustive, but should give a good overview. So my advice:
  - XFS: in general, go for it. It will work out of the box and has some advanced feature such as COW, checksum
  - BTRFS: go for it on Linux you want the extra features but are ok with the added complexity and maintenance
  - ZFS: don't, except for very specific use cases. (On *BSD, Solaris its another story)

- XFS/EXT4 have been around a long time and considered "stable" and are good to start out as there is much documentation. 
- xfs is solid and faster than ext4 IME. It also has much nicer code.
- Ext4. I tried f2fs recently and grub has some nasty bugs with it. Braking the efi quite often.
- I’m using xubuntu and zfs is shipped with grub snapshot support you don’t need to do anything. I think its better than btrfs and easier.

- ## 最近搞了个有趣的玩法，用JuiceFS把PG当成文件系统用，可以实现FS/DB一致的时间点恢复。
- https://x.com/RonVonng/status/1902943946051104890
  - 像Odoo这样的应用就能把所有状态都放在数据库里，而不是在外面还留个文件系统的“小尾巴” 了。
- PG 撑得住？不会越来越臃肿吗？而且所有的文件都走PG的话，文件系统撑得住？
