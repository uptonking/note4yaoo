  - https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview
  - Application Architecture for Building User Interfaces
  - We recommend using more sophisticated alternatives like Redux, MobX, Recoil, Zustand, or Jotai.
  - Flux is more of a pattern than a framework
  - However, we often use `EventEmitter` as a basis for `Store`s and React for our `View`s
  - The one piece of Flux not readily available elsewhere is the `Dispatcher`.

  - A pluggable container for universal flux applications.
  - üëâüèª Singleton-free for server rendering 
    - Stores are classes that are instantiated per request or client session. 
    - This ensures that the stores are isolated and do not bleed information between requests.
  - Facebook‚Äôs Flux only works on the client, but it may be easier to figure out since it doesn‚Äôt have to deal with concurrency issues.

- https://github.com/davezuko/re-frame /13Star/MIT/201912/js/inactive
  - Vanilla JavaScript port of the popular ClojureScript library for pragmatic, flux-like state management
  - Re-frame helps make state management predictable, testable, and pragmatic. It achieves this via message passing, which decouples action from intent. 
  - On top of this, it provides first-class semantics for dealing with side-effects
  - From a high-level, re-frame is flux-like with events and event handlers, which are similar to redux's actions and reducers. 
  - Compared to redux, re-frame is more feature complete out of the box, with built-in interceptors, effects, subscriptions, and test utilities.

  - Isomorphic flux implementation
  - 100% Flux: Unidirectional data flow
    - stores have no setters, 
    - Actions are fire and forget
    - you get constants, and Flux's single central dispatcher. All Stores receive the dispatch
  - Isomorphic and works with react-native. Server Side Rendering
  - At any point in time you can take a snapshot of the entire application state and then reload it later
  - Extremely flexible and unopinionated in how you use flux. 
    - Create traditional singletons or use dependency injection.
    - your asynchronous data fetching can live in the actions, or they can live in the stores. 
    - Stores may also be traditional singletons as in flux, or you can create an instance and have multiple store copies. This leads us into server side rendering.
  - Creating separate instances of flux rather than relying on singletons can help when building isomorphic applications.
    - Singletons only become a problem if you wish to share data fetching with client and server
    - Taking this approach means you're making the trade-off of injecting the flux instance into your application in order to retrieve the stores and use the actions. 
    - This approach is similar to how fluxible solves isomorphic applications.

  - https://acdlite.github.io/flummox
  - modular, testable, isomorphic Flux. No singletons required.
  - No singletons = isomorphism for free
  - What makes Flummox special? 
    - Flummox allows you to encapsulate your entire Flux set-up ‚Äî stores, actions, constants, and the dispatcher ‚Äî into a single class, with zero singletons or global references.
    - `const flux = new Flux();` ÂàùÂßãÂåñ
    - There are many benefits to this approach, but the biggest one is that it makes isomorphism (running the same code on both the server and the client) incredibly straightforward.
  - The primary goal of Flummox is reduce the boilerplate involved in setting up Flux for your application, so the API has been kept as minimal and predictable as possible. It uses Facebook‚Äôs dispatcher under the hood.
  - isomorphic is one of the biggest motivating factors for creating this library. 
    - Isomorphism is tricky or impossible in many other Flux libraries because they rely on singleton objects, spread out across multiple modules.
    - because Flummox does not rely on singletons, you get isomorphism for free: just create a new Flux instance on each request
    - Flummox also gives you the ability to serialize the initial state of your application on the server, send it down to the client as a string
  - The dispatcher and constants are implementation details ‚Äî no need to interact with them unless you want to

  - http://github.hubspot.com/general-store
  - Simple, flexible store implementation for Flux
  - aims to provide all the features of a Flux store without prescribing the implementation of that store's data or mutations.
  - All other features, like Immutability, data fetching, undo, etc. are implementation details.
  - Using Redux devtools extension you can inspect the state of a store

- https://github.com/ohager/nanoflux /201702/js
  - lightweight and dependency-free Flux implementation
  - uses a pure functional approach as a performant solution.
  - The idea of this implementation is to support a very small, but full Flux implementation (separated Action, Dispatcher, and Store), and also a "fluxy" version, with Action and Dispatcher merged in one unit.
