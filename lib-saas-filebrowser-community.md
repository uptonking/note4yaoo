- ## [OIDC Auth - loop with expired token _202507](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/995)
  - token expired or revoked
- just to confirm, you have password authentication disabled? When password authentication is enabled, OIDC should redirect to the login page instead of OIDC provider.

- Directly going to the filebrowser.example.com/login page also worked as a workaround.

- ## [Stable Release & 0.9.0 update _202509](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/discussions/1293)
  - A breakdown of some things to expect in 0.9.x:
  - jobs / async task
  - introduction of SQLite database: Initially, this will be primarily for job status information. eventually, this could enable RAM-free indexing and replace the existing simple (but very fast) database.

- ## [Investigate optimize for memory _202506](https://github.com/gtsteffaniak/filebrowser/issues/807)
  - Investigate and implement an option to index to the database instead of memory.

- The current database implementation (bolt) is incapable of supporting this feature. However, I could implement an SQLite temporary database to properly support a queryable database to accomplish this.

- in-memory indexing will still be ideal for `simple` and `normal` filesystem complexities, but many `complex` filesystems that require large memory footprints could take advantage of this.

- Been using Quantum for about a month now & it's so much better than the original. Tried other stuff like SFTPGo & others, but settled on filebrowser quantum. The indexing is insanely helpful for finding stuff. I know it's in beta, but it already feels feature complete.
  - Only feature I can think I'd want is a preview for fonts, but that's literally it.

- You can also disable indexing like this, but search won't work for anything you haven't "seen".
