# apps

# vscode-web
- https://github.com/Felx-B/vscode-web /js
  - This project is aimed to build a web version of VSCode, this is not a fork, simply a web compilation of the VSCode project.
  - Microsoft recently open sourced VSCode web compilation, so I simplified the build process to use the official compilation (no more tweak needed).
# vscode-server
- https://github.com/coder/code-server /ts
  - VS Code in the browser
  - Run VS Code on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.
  - Linux machine with WebSockets enabled, 1 GB RAM, and 2 vCPUs

- https://github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server
  - This project provides a version of VS Code that runs a server on a remote machine and allows access through a modern web browser. 
  - It's based on the very same architecture used by Gitpod or GitHub Codespaces at scale.
# vscode-integrations
- https://github.com/betatim/vscode-binder /python
  - VS Code on Binder, because sometimes you need a real editor.
