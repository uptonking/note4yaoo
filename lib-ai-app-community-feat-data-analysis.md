- ## Every decade, someone invents a "pivot table killer."

  - OLAP cubes. Self-service BI. Natural language queries. AI analytics.
  - Pivot tables survive them all.
  - Why? Because they're the rare tool that matches how business people actually think about data - dimensions, measures, filters. Not SQL. Not Python. Just drag and drop.
  - [Why Pivot Tables Never Die | ssp.sh _202502](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/why-pivot-tables-never-die/)

- It’s not pivot tables exactly, it’s measures and dimensions. Calculations that depend on their context (time, place, product, customer, etc.) Pivot tables are one way to display dimensional data, but not the only way.
  - We use measures when we speak: “What were the top 3 regions by year-on year revenue growth last year?” Sadly the natural-language-to-SQL industry knows about the relational model but not about measures and dimensions.
- They do now, and they’re taking it very seriously. I genuinely think one of the best outcomes of this whole AI wave is the realisation that you still need measures, dimensions, and all that stuff that was figured out 30 years ago

- underrated feature of gsheets it the ability to run pivot tables on top of bigquery!
