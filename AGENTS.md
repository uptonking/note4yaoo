# AGENT RULES

# common-rules

- if issue/problem/task is complex, prefer to use todo task list and update the task progress when working. 
- When a task requires deleting, moving, or renaming more than one file, stop and present a clear list of affected files. Do not execute the command until the user provides approval or confirmation. 
- System Configuration Changes Require Approval: When a task requires adding, updating, or deleting operating system configurations or system files, you must stop and present a clear list of all affected configurations/files before execution. Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding with any commands.
# markdown
- always prefer github-flavored markdown syntax
- when writing markdown list, always perfer using `-` as list item symbol for top level list item. 
  - for nested list item,  `*` may be preferable.
# coding
- when writing simple html webapp, always perfer self-contained and runnable html file with tailwindcss, you can refer to the existing html files like `toyapps/boilerplate/b1b1-tailwind-minimal.html`.
