- ## Got Vue 3 JSX working in Vite 2... with HMR!
- https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1345972081025036290
  - (via https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next)
- For those who are not familiar, Vue has always supported JSX and render functions, 
  - this is mostly about HMR support and the dedicated babel transform that can leverage Vue 3 specific optimizations
- When *should* you use JSX? 
  - Maybe never - it depends on your preference. 
  - If templates are working for you, stick to it because Vue can produce more efficient code from it. 
  - JSX/render functions can be useful when writing abstract and logic heavy components though.
