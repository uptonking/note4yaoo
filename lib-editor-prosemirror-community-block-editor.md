- ## how to turn the current paragraph into a heading and wraps it into a section.
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/how-to-make-changes-that-temporarily-violate-the-schema/4836
  - `tr.setNodeMarkup(pos, HeadingType).wrap(paragraph, {type: SectionType})` does not work

- It may be a more productive direction to relax your schema constraints, also for ease of editing (so users don‚Äôt have to understand a set of complicated transformation commands to create the documents they are interested in), and treat the desired structure more like a lint than a hard constraint.

- ## Nested draggable editors behave differently in all browsers_202111
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/nested-draggable-editors-behave-differently-in-all-browsers/3807
- This got me interested in how Prosemirror implements dragging of nodes that are editable since this is similar to that in a way. 
  - PM adds a draggable attribute on demand to such nodes (compare that to the example in glitch with a permanent draggable attribute), when it deems the user might be interested in drag. 
  - This makes me feel that a draggable attribute messes with an editable element and to solve the problem we might need to do something similar to what pm-view has done in src code

- I‚Äôd argue they are browser issues‚Äîüëâüèªthere‚Äôs no consensus on how draggable+editable text should work, and browsers do different things (even Chrome‚Äôs behavior isn‚Äôt ideal I think). It‚Äôs usually better to use drag handles separate from the editable text.

- I‚Äôve kept the custom view using `draggable: true` as without it, we‚Äôd lose dragging functionality. Instead, after initialization, I‚Äôm removing the `draggable="true"` attribute from the DOM element. This doesn‚Äôt seem to affect draggability, but does fix Firefox‚Äôs inability to select text.

- ## Detect block changes to manage blocks as separate data in backend
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/detect-block-changes-to-manage-blocks-as-separate-data-in-backend/4870
- Background
  - We are using Firestore (which is a NoSQL Database) to store data
  - Every first-level block of content(direct children of ‚Äúdoc‚Äù) should be stored as a single data(precisely, document in Firestore). So if the editor has two paragraphs, each paragraph is saved as two different data.
- Question - Is there a good way to detect ; 
  - when a new block content is added
  - when an existing block content is updated
  - when an existing block content is deleted
- 

- ## Block structure editor by prosemirror_202003
- https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/block-structure-editor-by-prosemirror/2620
  - notion‚Äôs block is an independent contenteditable dom, which only has an independent node (table/calendar or other nodeType)
  - I am wandering if separate all my schema into each mini-prosemirror editor and have a doc container that holds all the mini-prosemirror, can i achieve the block structure style new editor as notion.
  - besides, doc contains too many prosemirror instance will affect performance severely Ôºü

- You can, but I don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd want that. **Separating your document into multiple editors breaks things like cross-block selections**. This type of setup complicates user interaction, and I never really understood what advantage it brings.
  - in my opinion, notion block structure makes it flexible to save the data, cus doc can be described as two part: block-id-list, block-content-data-hashmap
  - besides, each block has it's own menubar popover, so user don't need move mouse up to top menubar and down to editor frequently, make user experience better.
  - in my project, i want treat table as database to make table data accessable and sharable between different user's docs, maybe block style can be a little bit easier.
  - Notion‚Äôs solution to this is quite nice: dragging a selection across two blocks creates a selection containing the whole of both blocks.

- Presumably it allows for larger documents without scaling issues, as the editor only needs to run calculations for the block currently being edited.

- Notion style block editor can be done using Prosemirror without multiple editors as you can hook into hover events and get all the information you need using `posAtCoords`.
