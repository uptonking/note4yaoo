  - https://jesterkit.com/exe
  - A build tool to distribute your full-stack web app as a single executable binary with zero runtime dependencies.
  - Unlike static builds that strip away server capabilities, EXE preserves all server-side features of your full stack framework: SSR, API endpoints, server middleware, server-side authentication, etc.
  - Single binary, no runtime dependencies.
  - A full-stack SvelteKit web app tilemap engine compiled with EXE. Running locally.
  - Nuxt and TanStack are also supported but experimental.
  - [Tanstack build error ](https://github.com/Hugo-Dz/exe/issues/14)
    - install via package.json overrides
  - [Feature request: support for webview/arbitrary code in server ](https://github.com/Hugo-Dz/exe/issues/15)
    - I think EXE is not really the right path to ship desktop apps. It's meant for server self-hosting and serving. And while one might use compiled apps locally, it's not the it's main purpose.
    - I'd recommend using Tauri for anything desktop apps, I'm using it for Sprite Fusion and it works super well.
  - [Question about the project _202509](https://github.com/Hugo-Dz/exe/issues/3)
    - Why the executable is too large (arround 106 MB for a small project)
    - It indeed packs the Bun runtime so regarding the platform, the size of the executable is between 60 and 100 MB. I'm working on something to divide its size by 2 with compression, but at runtime, the decompressed binary will be loaded in memory anyway.

- https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es /apache2/202512/ts
  - https://connectrpc.com/docs/web/query/getting-started
  - TypeScript-first expansion pack for TanStack Query that gives you Protobuf superpowers.
  - wrapper around TanStack Query (react-query), written in TypeScript and thoroughly tested. It enables effortless communication with servers that speak the Connect Protocol.
  - [Connect Protocol Reference | Connect](https://connectrpc.com/docs/protocol/)
    - This document specifies the Connect protocol for making RPCs over HTTP. 
    - Remain conceptually close to gRPC's HTTP/2 protocol, so Connect implementations can support both protocols.
    - When used with Protocol Buffer schemas, the Connect protocol supports unary, client streaming, server streaming, and bidirectional streaming RPCs, with either binary Protobuf or JSON payloads.
    - The protocol doesn't use HTTP trailers at all, so it works with any networking infrastructure.
