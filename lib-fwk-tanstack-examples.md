  - A demonstration of how to implement dynamic breadcrumbs in TanStack Start that automatically update after mutations using router.invalidate().
  - Server-Side Rendering: Organizations and employees are loaded via server functions
  - Dynamic Breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs are prerendered on the server and update reactively on the client
  - Real-time Updates: Edit organization/employee names and watch the breadcrumbs update instantly
