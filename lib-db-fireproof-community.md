- ## üí°ü§î The meaning of the term "CRDT" is really starting to drift.
- https://twitter.com/LewisCTech/status/1719807159217844603
  - Libraries like automerge and yjs are just *implementations* that happen to be a CRDT. 
  - But the idea of a CRDT itself is much older. I've seen "proto-CRDTs" described as far back as 4 decades.
- CRDTs are just abstract data types with operations that follow some algebraic laws, that guarantee they will converge in a sensible way. That's really it. They don't need to be complicated. They don't even need to be single record - a whole DB could itself constitute a CRDT.
  - Agree. üõãÔ∏è @CouchDB is a CRDT at the database level and at the document level. @FireproofStorge is one at the database level. Also, all Merkle-diffs are CRDTs.

- ## üí° One of the biggest challenges in creating @FireproofStorge is that I refused to take on infrastructure operations.

  - This means the entire database has to be built to run anywhere. (It eats trash, so you don‚Äôt have to.)
  - Fireproof is like SQLite, it runs embedded in your application. This means it‚Äôs my job to make it so nobody has to worry about compiling dependencies, or making a misconfiguration that loses data.
  - I could have created a minimal backend that runs in a container or some other abstraction layer. But that is not the path of simplicity, and simplicity is one of the competitive advantages someone like me can offer.
  - Instead, the focus is on making it work with any backend from S3 to the file system to @IPFS and @partykit_io ‚Äî this requires a level of focus on the storage engine that I haven‚Äôt seen in other browser databases.
  - Because we use content addressed data, our files are self-verifying. But that is only half the battle, because a database that stores files anywhere could be putting your data everywhere. I couldn‚Äôt in good conscience be writing app data to random public buckets, in the clear for anyone to read.
  - Fireproof is end-to-end encrypted by default. This means if you manage your keys correctly, it can be as secure as you want. And if you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, at least you‚Äôre not spraying clear data all over the place.
  - The result is a database that any front-end developer will feel at home with, but also lets them get work done without asking for anything from the backend team.

- ü§î why do u choose ipfs instead of hypercore ?
  - If hypercore can shuffle binary blobs, then they work the same for Fireproof.  I started with IPFS because of the IPLD data structures, which are the center of interesting research for immutability. But that stuff is independent of the actual transport.
  - The content addressable trees and CRDTs that come from @mikeal , @_alanshaw and friends are at the forefront of the industry. I saw my opportunity to package that fundamental advancement for the masses.

- ## üõãÔ∏è As someone coming from databases like HCL Notes/Domino or CouchDB, Fireproof looks pretty familiar and powerful. _202312
- https://discord.com/channels/1142273421674303619/1142286889588629604/1191037240873320568
  - All three have concepts of changes feeds that can be leveraged to incrementally update external indexes. 
  - What I don't find in the Fireproof docs is how deletions get reported in the changes callback. We need those to remove entries from the external index.
  - And I am curious what indexers you have in mind for persistent views of data, e.g. to keep b-trees with selected doc data persistent on disk and to have flexible queries for fast index-optimized filtering/sorting. 
  - We could mirror Fireproof doc data in Sqlite for that and use SQL for queries, but maybe you found another package/approach, something with a query planner that picks indexes if needed/available. 
  - The database.query method seems to run the JS function on each DB document, which probably is too slow for large amounts of docs (e.g. when syncing a whole CRM system to the client).
- there is a config flag to persist the indexes so they are incremental on page reload, I haven't been documenting the fine-grained config b/c I hope to normalize it before we move out of beta. You can try the `persistIndexes` option, which should add incrementalism 
  - currently we tombstone for deletes, and there are a couple of loose ends as the underlying CRDT is adding more advanced delete support, which we'll be able to use in our index manager
  - Your idea of using SQLite as a specialized index is a great one for folks who are happy to take on that dependency. 
  - My goal with Fireproof will be to hone(‰ΩøÊõ¥ÈîãÂà©) the implementation to a simple as possible, so the incremental indexes won't be going away, but for something with a query planner you will likely want an add-on

- Oh, didn't know that the indexes have a persistIndex option. That's already a good start to have fast data lookups in an app. I thought the current implementation was rebuilding the index on every app load.  Is there also a method to delete a stored index afterwards? Then I could create them on demand (e.g. when a user resorts a grid), track when they are last used and do an auto-cleanup for indexes not used for some time.
  - Regarding deletion handling, Notes/Domino keeps so called deletion stubs in the database for some time (e.g. 3 months) so that replicating clients know that something got deleted and needs to be deleted on client side as well. A deletion stub just contains the document id and a date. After that period, deletion stubs get purged and docs coming in from clients would actually reappear on the server side during replication, but IBM (or HCL who bought the product years ago) added a DB option to prevent replicating too old data.
  - Would be great if there was a compact option for Fireproof so that deleting content eventually removes it from the database or at least just keeps a tombstone without more data in the DB (for privacy reason and to reduce the DB size). But I know nothing (yet) about the CRDT you are using.  So not sure this is possible.

- Stoked to have Lotus folks in the room! Currently compaction preserves all data, but we aren‚Äôt religious(ÂÆóÊïôÁöÑÔºåËôîËØöÁöÑ) about that

- CouchDB should have focussed on the embedded use case, instead of warping the project into a clustered solution. SQLite is great as a foundation for clustered solutions, and CouchDB was also. What we did at Couchbase to scale it makes sense but the core project should have stayed with its roots, IMHO.
  - üèòÔ∏è I think of Fireproof databases as a "unit of collaboration" so maybe you'd have one database for each collaborative doc, whiteboard, chat room, chess game, etc. And then another per-user database to track the collaborative groups of interest for that user. That's how the more complex apps I've built with it are arranged.
  - As far as filtered replication, you could have a cloud function subscribe to server database A and write a subset of records to server database B. The leaf nodes holding the document bodies get their own CIDs, so "all it would take" is implementing a unified storage mode, and you'd get deduplication across server database records despite different filters. In this case, server database B would contain pointers to a subset of records from server database A, and the user would replicate server database B. (The default encryption mode breaks the deduplication, but running it in clear mode is a step in that direction for now.)
  - My stress testing has been in the multi-writer scenario, to ensure blocks are never communicated that aren't yet available. The slow path is finding lowest common ancestor in the CRDT, so workloads that involve multi-writer concurrency are most challenging. For single writer workloads, or workloads that are paused when the merge backlog grows, the big-O is comparable to other databases.

- ## üöÄ fireproof.storage Light up your data!_202303

  - check out my new project, a real-time database that runs in any page, with indexes, event feeds, automatic replication, and cryptographic verifiability. 
- It either took me two weeks to write this JSON database, or 14 years.
  - Part of what makes it so easy to use is that it‚Äôs an embedded database with network support, like PouchDB or Couchbase Lite. So developers don‚Äôt have to worry about setting it up, nor do they have to worry about where the data is stored.
  - The current version just keeps data in browser local storage, but it manages transactions and blocks using the immutable IPFS protocol. This means you can save and load data from almost anywhere.
  - The combination of lightweight runtime, and the ability to reach across the network for blocks, makes me tell my kids I‚Äôm making an ‚Äúinfinite database.‚Äù
- Limitations: currently encryption is living on a branch that I will merge as soon as I figure out the last webpack issues
- Some of the prime use cases for this sort of technology:
  - adding dynamic features to static pages 
  - saving/memoizing pure functional transforms in a verifiable way (cough: prompt, model, params) 
  - serving as a content-addressed oracle for smart-contract execution 
  - games!

- Are the indexes local-only or also synced? For integration in non-JS codebases, is there a spec to interoperate?
  - The indexes use the same block store as the database, so when you activate replication, they also sync to @Web3Storage , but I think this will be optional, as you‚Äôd rather rebuild than copy when you‚Äôre on a slow connection.
  - Another option I‚Äôll be adding soon is the ability to serialize the current state as a single car file so that you can embed it in your app for instant preload
  - As far as a spec, not yet. I plan to swap out some of the core data structures with more nuanced implementations, at which point that will be front of mind.

- üÜöÔ∏è How does it differ from Pouch?
  - One of the stand-out use cases for this is adding features to Web3 style link in profile pages. Because if you‚Äôre deploying HTML that has its content hash in a block chain somewhere, and the html contains the root hash of your database. Merkle!
