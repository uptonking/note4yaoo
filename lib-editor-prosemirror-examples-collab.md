  - Commit-based collaborative editing plugin for ProseMirror.
  - This solves two key problems with `prosemirror-collab` through server-side rebasing without the use of CRDTs:
    - Throughput: 200 active clients per 1s of commit delay is feasible depending on backend implementation and edit characteristics.
    - Fairness: Users with high latencies will not have their edits blocked by users with low latencies. This will greatly smooth the collab experience on documents with high levels of concurrent edits.

  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36959889
    - A commit-based collab plugin that's far more performant under heavily active client loads than stock. I'm a fan of YJS, but not a fan of state-based CRDT layer on top of ProseMirror for my use cases
    - I also translated the core ProseMirror projects of model, transform, and test-builder to C#
    - I spent quite a bit of time as an FTE building out a robust-ish and efficient Yjs backend POC. 
    - At the end of it all my personal takeaways were:
    * State-based CRDT isn't great when you want a central authority in the mix anyway and are fundamentally trying to work with operations
    * The exchange rate between ProseMirror's currency, steps, and some other replication strategies building blocks is too high
    * ProseMirror should add the concept of range-relocation to its mappings; this is a bit of an aside but it would help retain user intent when reconciling concurrent edits involved in block relocations

  - PeerDoc is a collaborative real-time rich-text editor with undo/redo, cursor tracking, inline comments, permissions/sharing control over documents, a change history. 
  - 依赖meteor、vuetify、prosemirror
  - it provides two types of collaboration:
    - real-time collaboration between collaborators on the draft of the document (push-based collaboration).Push-based collaboration is collaboration where a change can be made directly (pushed).
    - fork and merge request style of collaboration with others, allowing collaboration to scale beyond a small group of collaborators (pull-based collaboration). Pull-based collaboration works by offering a change that must be approved before it is integrated (pulled). 
  - PeerDoc is a stable prototype. It has been already used in production.
  - Rebasing requires branches to have a shared base
  - When a fork is merged, it can no longer be edited and changes from the parent document are not propagated to it. When a fork is merged, it can no longer be edited and changes from the parent document are not propagated to it. 
  - PeerDoc does not have all the answers (yet) about how exactly to best use a combination of these two types of collaboration.
  - PeerDoc currently rebases all changes and maintains a linear history of all documents, but would a branched history without rebasing be better when trying to understand how documents came about?

# collab-solutions

  - ProseMirror's support for collaborative editing requires an "authority server". 
  - The reference implementation of an authority server stores the current document and steps in-memory, and uses functions exported by ProseMirror libraries to apply steps to a document. 
  - This repo tries to evaluate alternatives to running an authority server in node. 
  - This repo has a node.js and Go implementation of an HTTP endpoint that receives a ProseMirror document and array of steps, hydrates them using a specific ProseMirror schema, applies the steps to the document, and returns the results. 
  - The benchmark scripts start each server, and send requests to them, collecting latency information.
  - Results:

  - using a sync database ( PouchDB, but it works with firebase ) as a communication layer between client and server.

  - collaboratively edit texts without relying on a central server. 
  - Each user has a copy of the collaborative document on their own device stored inside IndexedDB. 
  - Editorial then uses WebRTC to make a direct connection between the browsers of different users to exchange changes to the document.

- https://github.com/saranrapjs/prosemirror-automerge /201904/js/inactive
  - experiment with wiring automerge up to ProseMirror
  - The basic idea is to have a ProseMirror plugin that works similarly to the collab plugin: steps which originate from the editor are translated to an Automerge document, and changes to a "remote" Automerge document are translated back to the ProseMirror document as steps.

  - Improvements over prosemirror-collab:
    - Server-side rebasing drastically reduces network round-trips
    - Steps are queued and sent as commits, reducing overhead
    - When possible, steps are merged prior to network transport
