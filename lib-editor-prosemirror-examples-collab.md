# crdt/yjs
- https://github.com/yjs/y-prosemirror
  - ProseMirror editor binding for Yjs

- https://github.com/idealjs/chao-feng
  - 依赖 yjs

- https://github.com/pamphlets/editorial
  - https://github.com/pamphlets/pamphlet /pm-editor
  - 依赖y-prosemirror、yjs、y-webrtc
  - collaboratively edit texts without relying on a central server. 
  - Each user has a copy of the collaborative document on their own device stored inside IndexedDB. 
  - Editorial then uses WebRTC to make a direct connection between the browsers of different users to exchange changes to the document.

- https://github.com/fadiquader/prosemirror-collaborative-editor
  - collaborative editor for React built with Prosemirror + Yjs + mongodb

- https://github.com/tororosoba0534/collab-note-yjs-wsserver
  - Collab-Note-YJS is a multi-repo project which divided by two repositories (frontend and backend). 

- https://github.com/saranrapjs/prosemirror-automerge /201904/js/inactive
  - experiment with wiring automerge up to ProseMirror
  - The basic idea is to have a ProseMirror plugin that works similarly to the collab plugin: steps which originate from the editor are translated to an Automerge document, and changes to a "remote" Automerge document are translated back to the ProseMirror document as steps.

  - Improvements over prosemirror-collab:
    - Server-side rebasing drastically reduces network round-trips
    - Steps are queued and sent as commits, reducing overhead
    - When possible, steps are merged prior to network transport
