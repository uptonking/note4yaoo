- ## 使用飞书的时候查看图片不是用mac自带的“预览”，而是在飞书自己的窗口中打开，
- https://twitter.com/TooooooBug/status/1630761293924945920
  - 导致一些常用的图片操作都不能很顺利地进行，甚至OCR识别也不行（尽管飞书也加了这个能力，但不是很灵光）。一开始非常非常不理解，但这两天突然想明白为什么要这么做了
- 主要是为了实现撤回对方哪怕打开查看了也不可见的目的吧，如果用本机的程序预览，就很难做到这个技术实现了。
- 可以审计图片的查看、传播链
- 协同涂鸦
- to B的软件不可以随意加审核删除的，这是企业的权利。另外像企业微信，用预览看图，如果撤回了图片，正在预览的图片也会消失的。

- ## Notion 优化了走直线选不中子级菜的问题，想起之前 @height_app 的一篇关于 context menus 细节的文章。
- https://twitter.com/leadream4/status/1629307997175549952
  - 一般的解决方案是加一个延迟，但是更好的方式是增加三角安全区域，亚马逊和苹果都是这样处理的。

  - `clip-path` is a cool css property that lets you define a region of the component that should be drawn to the screen. In this case we use a polygon to draw a triangle.

- ## Personally, if I had a choice, I would always, always, always start designing with a click-menu instead of a hover menu
- https://twitter.com/vitalyf/status/1630481527497687040
  - Hover menus delays will be too fast for some users, too slow for others; the UI can feel confusing and frustrating, and unresponsive.

- ## GitHub is experimenting with interactive README components, called "blocks."
- https://twitter.com/FredKSchott/status/1590438076677238784
  - https://blocks.githubnext.com/
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKZg0DScucw&t=23782s
- “I’m a README developer”
- Interesting! My hopes: implemented via directives (hopefully) or fenced code lang flags (like their new task lists, also okay).
- That's cool but i did it first, built with Astro

- ## 想从零实现一个富文本编辑器是不是天坑……
- https://twitter.com/waylybaye/status/1531463471371800576
- https://github.com/Icemic/huozi.js
  - A simple typography engine for CJK languages, especially designed for game rich-text. 用于游戏富文本的中日韩文字排印引擎。
- 活字 JS 应该能满足基础的 Web 排版自绘需求，或者 Skia 提供的 CanvasKit WASM 也能实现。自己从头做的话可利用 HarfBuzz 的 shaping 结果查找字形 glyph，自行将它们分多 run 在平面上放置并折行。
- 我之前为了兼容性尝试做过一个canvas渲染纯文本显示的，坑太多了弃了，老老实实嵌入webview

- ## 💡 Heptabase 面向未来的知识操作系统
- https://sspai.com/post/71842
- Hepta 的组织架构包括 Timeline、Tags、Map、Card Library。
  - Hepta 便是由这些 App 构成的 Productivity App Store。
  - 这四个 App 实质上是为用户提供了一个 收集 → 初步整理 → 深度思考 → 资料库 的完整工作流。
  - Timeline 模式借鉴了 Roam Research 等产品倡导的 Daily Notes 设计，以及 Twitter 等产品的思绪流理念。每一天，你打开 Timeline，便可以快速收集你的各种灵感和想法。
  - 当你在 Timeline 模式中进行快速记录时，顺手打上标签，你的卡片便会自动进入 Tags 模式的卡片分类之中
  - Map 是 Hepta 的核心功能和特色功能。Map = WhiteBoards（相互关联的 Cards）。你可以在 Map 中自由创建白板 WhiteBoard，而在每个白板之中，你又可以自由创建无数相关关联的卡片。深度思考或者创造的核心，在于将抽象的思想具体化，并且使得想法相互碰撞中进行升华。传统的深度思考工具便是写作。然而单纯的文档写作无法以高效地方式呈现思维过程，因此，人们会使用思维导图、概念图、白板等思维工具。
  - Card Library 负责对于信息和知识的聚合管理，属于你的知识库。在这个知识库中，你将可以使用多种方式对内容进行管理和呈现。
- Hepta 的 Map 模式，本质上便是由若干个 Card 组成的 Whiteboard，即 Map Mode= Whiteboards (Card & Card)。
  - 如何理解 Hepta 中的 Whiteboard & Card？目前，存在两种理解方式：
  - Hepta : Whiteboard & Card = Roam : Page & Block；
  - 第一种方法，适合进行卡片笔记写作
  - Hepta : Whiteboard & Card = EverNote : Folders & Page；
  - 第二种方法，适合进行项目管理
  - 上面只是两种理想状态，具体取决于不同用户的使用习惯。最好的方法便是基于卡片的自由组合：短的内容视为 Block, 长的内容视为 Page。
- 目前，Hepta 开发团队只有三人。除了维持几乎一天一版的高开发速度，开发者每天还需要响应处理 20-50 名用户的客户服务需求，以及大量的 1 - 1 视频教学。

- 他们后端用的firebase，底层数据结构应该还是基于文档的
  - 协同应该也是基于firebase的文档同步做的，已经输了
  - 编辑器本身不够牛逼，我觉得方法论级别的大多数革命性特性都是空中楼阁
  - 我们要做更好的tag、更好的search、更好的block扩展

- 我们block-editor的数据结构已经有前人实践过了，缺的只是一个更好的展现方式
  - 这种block式结构，我已知最早的实现是fossil
  - 由sqlite的作者开发的scm，实际上blockdb的前身文档数据库就参考了部分设计，只是针对当时的整体架构做了调整
  - 当我们再次将颗粒度细化到block层级后，实际上就变成了一个better fossil了
  - fossil基于block结构实现了crdt的版本管理工具，我们则实现了crdt的编辑器
  - fossil同样使用block存issue、pr、wiki等等数据，殊途同归
  - 以后 blockdb powered by rust 说不定可以联系下作者
  - yjs目前还没成为瓶颈，等啥时候成了瓶颈，就可以考虑wasm版blockdb了
- 先盈利比较重要
  - 也可能转型做技术开源的公司，商业混不下去
  - 目前我们还在构建服务阶段，大多数时候创业创新产品，速度快比技术快更重要
  - 大多数项目都没有性能优化的门票
  - 过早优化适合兴趣项目，没有盈利要求，自己投资自己

- 以后大可以用flomo整理block-editor的card，双向同步

- ## storybook Component Encyclopedia is in beta
- https://twitter.com/storybookjs/status/1491806826739941377
- We’re on a mission catalog the world’s UI components for you to learn from—3, 490 components & 44 projects so far.
  - Reference components from top teams
  - Play with live implementation 
  - view source

- ## Notion、WordPress 等有基于Block概念的编辑器。人们喜欢 Block。
- https://twitter.com/EryouHao/status/1486954447943057409
  - 我们似乎标准化了一件事：插入新 Block 的 / 键。但是其他所有的内容都是完全专有且非标准的
  - 如果在网络上的 Block 是可互换和可重复使用的，不是很酷吗？
  - 于是一个开放的、免费的、非专有的协议诞生了
- https://blockprotocol.org/
  - https://github.com/blockprotocol/blockprotocol
  - An open standard for building and using data-driven blocks. Make your applications both human and machine-readable.
  - Any valid HTML is already a block.

- ## I’m working on a spike(尖刺) for TLDraw’s renderer, replacing the current “one big SVG” approach with lots of divs for each shape instead.
- https://twitter.com/steveruizok/status/1436638874432851968
  - The goal is to support “shapes” that render regular HTML, not just SVG elements like `<rect>` or `<path>` , which is the current limitation.
  - Instead, the renderer should be able to put any React component on the page. Most of the current shapes will return SVG elements, but shapes like Text wouldn’t have to.
  - The biggest trade off here is auto-sizing `<g>` elements, which are awesome. Since SVG elements are basically `overflow:hidden` , we’ll need to pad the shapes more based on the zoom level.
- My one concern would be files will tend to stop being SVG compatible as the files gets laden with non SVG components. So no clean export. I want non-SVG components though too. Perhaps being able to have constrained parent objects that only allow SVG children so people can intent.
  - **SVG export is more of a “app level” feature vs a “renderer level” feature**, so it’s really up to what you do with it. No reason we can’t still have good SVG export in the tldraw app.
  - For example, if I had a post-it component that I rendered in HTML, in order to make it easier to edit on the page, I could still write my export code to create an SVG shape from its data.
- Is `foreignObject` not an option? I was hoping that we can start using it in projects that don’t need to support IE (which I’m assume TLDraw doesn’t).
- I'm basically doing something similar to this for the visual editor. It's still one big SVG, but also a `foreignElement` that positions HTML elements (single one for perf reasons)

- ## So, dumb question: you're building a (small) Postgres/Node/Vue web application that has a feature where user can upload file, and retrieve it later. Where do you store the file?
- https://twitter.com/stevage1/status/1433215485051613187
  - 结论是避免过早优化
  1. In the DB
  2. On disk on the Node server
  3. In S3
  4. Some other third party?
- If it's a small number of files and there are no big files, I'd definitely go with 1. That way you cut out the AWS dependency and you have all the data in a single place.
- No.1 is also good because of the concurrency guarantees - can use as a rudimentary message queue
- Must be some library out there to make 3 easy? In Python/Django, there's a package that just shims it in so it looks like reading/writing to local disk, and generates signed URLs as needed.
- Depending on how hard you anticipate making the switch later if it starts to cause issues... I'd probably give 1 a crack. Avoid premature optimisation, a bit easier in the short term etc
  - The aws-sdk for node is not that complicated, but you wanna be mindful of security then

- ## I'm super impressed by the approach @craftdocsapp is taking to data ownership. 
- https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1374144532976168967
  - 提出了制定markdown在线多人共同编辑协议的建议
  - At the same time, I think they're hitting the limits of modern data storage platforms, and hinting at precisely why we need a new kind of "collaborative filesystem".
- As context, Craft is an iOS/Mac notetaking app w/ a "blocks" model that feels inspired by Notion.
  - Unlike Notion it's offline-first (= very fast!). 
  - The interesting thing is they offer two different ways to store your data
- Option 1 is to sync your notes to Craft's servers.
  - The benefit of this is you get realtime collaboration, and you can share a web link with anyone to get comments. 
  - Feels similar to GDocs/Notion, just with much better offline mode.
- Option 2 is to store data on your filesystem. 
  - The benefit here is data ownership: more privacy, and you can open the files in other apps without issue.
- Now, if you want sync with Option 2, you can bring your own w/ iCloud Drive etc. But if two devices edit concurrently, you'll hit conflicts.
  - They currently store data in a JSON format but are trying to move to Markdown as a canonical storage format. Would make the "data ownership" even more meaningful since you could just edit their files w/ any Markdown editor!
- So, to review -- user gets to choose either Option 1 or 2 for any note. Which is already amazing and beyond most other apps!
  - But... it's also annoying that I have to choose. Could we have an Option 3 where we get the best of both worlds?
  - Concretely, what I want is something like a "filesystem", where I own the data and can open it in whatever app I choose.
  - But I don't want manual conflict merging every time two people simultaneously edit a doc. The "filesystem" needs to know how to merge changes.
- In other words: why does Craft (and Figma and GDocs and Notion and Pitch...) have to implement their own custom realtime sync protocol?
  - Could we just have a user-owned "filesystem" that deals w/ that part? So I can open a file in multiple apps, and have them sync in realtime?
- **The world I'm imagining** is one where I have Craft open, and you have Notion open, and another collaborator has VSCode open and we're all editing the same document live, perhaps from slightly different perspectives.
  - Curious if people think this "new collaborative filesystem" would be valuable and what the biggest challenges are.
  - To me, feels like the biggest tension is standardizing vs. diverging "file formats", and seeing how much common ground can be found between apps.
- Some intriguing projects which are taking on aspects of this challenge:
  - Braid (braid.org), a generic protocol for state sync
  - Fission (fission.codes), platform for building apps where users own the data
- The original local-first article from I&S is always worth a re-read for thinking about this tradeoff space.
  - But I think the extra tricky part is going beyond "individual devs should do local-first" to "we should have a cross-app local-first FS"
- I believe that future is possible with event sourcing. @todoist somewhat done this with their sync API.
- As long as we have:
  - websocket/web etc
  - ordered list of events 
  - SDK that convert events to data
