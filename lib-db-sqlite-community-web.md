- ## Existing persistence tech like IndexedDB is hamstrung(Â¶®Á¢çÔºåÈôêÂà∂) on iOS by bugs & tricky to program correctly on any platform.

  - SQLite/WASM + origin specific file system is promising but not available on iOS (yet?)

- ## Tested around with WASM SQLite + Origin Private File System and got it running in #orclAPEX.

  - Works great and is amazingly fast. 
  - My vision is offline-first Plug-Ins that integrate well with APEXs Low Code approach.
- Basically I dream of 2+ Plug-ins.
  - First does sync. It downloads data from a given query to SQLite in the users browser so we can access it offline (this is the bleeding edge part bc not all browsers can do it yet. + it sends changes on the client back to DB to merge.
  - Secondly I want to modify my Grid Plug-in so it accesses this offline SQLite storage instead of the Oracle DB. Changes are written back to SQLite and later synced by the first plugin.
  - Now we have a offline Grid editing experience by only adding 2 Plug-ins.
- SQLite is cool for this because it is fast with lots of data and I can ‚Äûmirror‚Äú my source table and add indexes and constraints.
  - Other browser storage options are either nosql, slow or just weird (IndexedDB üòÖ).
