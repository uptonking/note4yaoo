- ## what is an ExoticComponent?
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55954624
- The `ExoticComponent` is a workaround for typing special components (hence the name "exotic"), which do not behave as regular `React.Component` or `React.FunctionComponent` , but we still want TypeScript to interpret them as a kind of component.
  - NOTE: Exotic component cannot be called.
