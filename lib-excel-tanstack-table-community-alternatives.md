- Sorry for grumbling, but back in the '90s we called tables “advanced” if they could work with multiple lazy db data sources, provide sub-tables for value selection, formulas and so on [1]. Multi-sorting, interactive filtering, grouping was just “regular”. These tables were basically the entire UI part of your database, apart from detail forms.

- My favorite feature in AG-grid is range-selection
  - glide-data-grid has it too

- The first thing I look for in these kinds of projects is "have the authors thought about accessibility?" In this case I found this in the pagination

- I am using Grid.js and I have used Datatables before. However I have not found “advanced” library in a sense that none of them can do good table collapsion and rendering on mobile. Are there any grid systems that could handle mobile particularly well?
