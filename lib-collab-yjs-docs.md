- This document roughly explains how Yjs works internally. 
- The Yjs CRDT algorithm is described in the YATA paper from 2016.
  - There are a handful of small improvements implemented in Yjs which aren't described in the paper.
  - The most notable is that items have an `originRight` as well as an `origin` property, which improves performance when many concurrent inserts happen after the same character.

- At its heart, Yjs is a list CRDT. 
- üëâüèª Everything is squeezed into a list in order to reuse the CRDT resolution algorithm
  - Arrays are lists of arbitrary items.
  - Text is a list of characters, optionally punctuated(‰∏çÊó∂ÊâìÊñ≠) by formatting markers and embeds for rich text support. 
  - Maps are lists of entries. The last inserted entry for each key is used
- Each client is assigned a unique clientID property on first insert. 
  - js-safe random 53-bit integer

- Deletions in Yjs are treated very differently from insertions. 
  - üëâüèª Insertions are implemented as a sequential operation based CRDT, but deletions are treated as a simpler state based CRDT.
# faq ü§î

## I get a new ClientID for every session, is there a way to make it static for a peer accessing the document?

- The ClientID is used for conflict resolution.
  - So it is important that you understand all side-effects of retaining a ClientID across sessions.
- The simple answer is: Yjs is designed to create a new ClientID for every session to avoid sync conflicts.
  - üëâüèª The recommended method to identify users is using the Awareness feature. 
- If you still want to retain a ClientID, you can do so by simply üö® overwriting the `ydoc.clientID` property. 
  - But you must ensure that no other `Y.Doc` instance is currently holding that ClientID. 
  - This is not always possible: A user might open several browser windows with the same user account. 
  - When two Y. Doc instances with the same ClientID exist, the document might get permanently corrupted without a way to recover.
  - So do this with caution.

## Structuring data in smaller YDocs

- One basically needs to decide on the following:
1. To use one or multiple YDocs for an entity or set of entities in your application.
2. How to structure the data within a YDoc.

- When reasoning around how to structure data in Yjs I recommend to consider these aspects:
1. **The flow of data for common use cases**: It can be good to group data that is often used together. In contrast, it may not be practical to load hundreds of YDocs at once or load new YDocs very frequently.
2. **Read/write permissions:** Permissions cannot be practically enforced within a YDoc, so you need to split data into multiple YDocs if you need different permissions for different parts of the data.
3. **Size is very rarely a practical problem** as long as you deal with human-entered text input. (See [benchmarks](https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks).)
4. **Separate structure and data:** In some cases, it can be practical to have one YDoc that holds only the id references across entities (eg. pages) and one YDoc per entity data. This is particularly relevant if you need different permission levels for different entities. If you have no need for granular control, a split like this may be unnecessarily complex.
5. **History and undo:** At what level is it natural to track edit history and perform undo? It is much easier to perform history tracking within a single YDoc rather than spread across multiple YDocs.
6. **Consider using a single top-level YMap:** Top-level shared types cannot be deleted, so you may want to structure all your data in a single top-level YMap, eg. `yDoc.getMap('data').get('page-1')`.
7. **Subdocuments:** You may also consider using [subdocuments](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/subdocuments). However, it gets a bit more complex and your provider may not support it.
# yjs-docs
- Yjs documents are collections of shared objects that sync automatically.

- Yjs doesn't make any assumptions about the network technology you are using. 
  - As long as all changes eventually arrive, the documents will sync. 
  - The order in which document updates are applied doesn't matter.
- Most shared editing solutions depend on a single source of truth - a central server - to perform conflict resolution. 
  - Yjs doesn't need a central source of truth. This enables you to design the backend using ideas from distributed system architecture. 

- Editor bindings are a concept in Yjs that allow us to bind the state of a third-party editor to a syncable Yjs document. 
  - The `ytext` object is a shared data structure for representing text. It also supports formatting attributes (i.e. bold and italic). 
  - Yjs automatically resolves concurrent changes on shared data so we don't have to worry about conflict resolution anymore. 
  - Then we synchronize ytext with the quill editor and keep them in-sync using the QuillBinding. 
  - Almost all editor bindings work like this. 

- editor doesn't sync to other clients yet! We need to choose a provider or implement our own communication protocol to exchange document updates with other peers.
- Providers sync Yjs documents through a communication protocol or a database. 
  - Most providers have in common that they use the concept of room-names to connect Yjs documents.
- Providers are meshable. 
  - You can connect multiple providers to a Yjs instance at the same time. 
  - Document updates will automatically sync through the different communication channels. 
  - Meshing providers can improve reliability through redundancy and decrease network delay.

- Awareness 
  - By sharing cursor locations and presence information, we help our users to actively work together. 
  - Most applications also assign a unique name and color to each user. 
  - This kind of information can be generally classified as "Awareness" information. 
  - It gives you hints about what other users are currently doing.
- We could share even more awareness information like the mouse position of each user, or a live video recording of each user. 
  - But when we share too much information, we distract our users from the task at hand. 
  - So it is important to find the right balance, that makes sense for your application.
- Awareness information isn't stored in the Yjs document, as it doesn't need to be persisted across sessions. 
  - Instead, we use a tiny state-based Awareness CRDT that propagates JSON objects to all users. 
  - When you go offline, your own awareness state is automatically deleted and all users are notified that you went offline. 
  - While this feature is optional, it is recommended that network providers implement the awareness protocol to make it easier to switch providers. 
- The fields of the Awareness CRDT are not standardized. You can set any JSON-encodable value.

- network providers sync document updates over a network protocol to other peers. 
  - Database providers sync document updates to a database.

- Shared types allow you to make every aspect of your application collaborative.
- Shared types are similar to common data types like Array, Map, or Set. 
  - The only difference is that they automatically sync & persist their state (using the providers) and that you can observe them.
- Shared type instances must be connected to a Yjs document so we can sync them. 
  - First, we define a shared type on a Yjs document. 
  - Then we can manipulate it and observe changes.
- You can even insert Yjs types, allowing you to create nested structures
  - Note that the above observer doesn't fire when you insert content into subArray
  - You need to create an observer on subArray instead
  - Alternatively you can observeDeep on yarray (allowing you to observe child-events as well)
- You can't insert the array at another place. A shared type can only exist in one place.
yarray.insert(0, [subArray]) // Throws exception!

- There are some things that are not possible with shared types, but that are possible with normal data types. 
  - Most importantly, it is not possible to move a type that was inserted into a Yjs document to a different location. 
  - The other important caveat is that you shouldn't modify JSON that you inserted or retrieved from a shared type. 
  - Yjs doesn't clone the inserted objects to improve performance. 
  - So when you modify a JSON object, you will actually change the internal representation of Yjs without notifying other peers of that change.

- All changes must happen in a transaction. 
  - When you mutate a shared type without creating a transaction (e.g. yarray.insert(..)), Yjs will automatically create a transaction before manipulating the shared object.
- Event handlers and observers are called after each transaction. 
  - If possible, you should bundle as many changes in a single transaction as possible. 
  - The advantage is that you reduce expensive observer calls and create fewer updates that are sent to other peers.
- Especially when manipulating many objects, it makes sense to reduce the creation of update messages. So use transactions whenever possible.

- We often want to manage multiple collaborative documents in a single Yjs document. 
  - You can manage multiple documents using shared types.

- Shared types are not just great for collaborative editing. 
  - They are a unique kind of data structure that can be used to sync any kind of state across servers, browsers, and soon also native applications.

## api

- Positions may represent cursor locations, selection ranges, or even assign a comment to a range of text. 
  - Normal index-positions (expressed as integers) are not convenient to use because the index-range is invalidated as soon as a remote change manipulates the document. 
  - Relative positions give you a powerful API to express positions.
- A relative position is fixated to an element in the shared document and is not affected by remote changes. 
- Relative positions are guaranteed to always point to the same location When all clients sync up, all relative positions will translate to the same index-position. This is not possible in OT-like solutions

## [Delta Format | Yjs Docs](https://docs.yjs.dev/api/delta-format)

- The Delta Format was originally described by the Quill rich text editor. 
  - We adapted the approach to describe changes on sequence-like data (e.g. `Y.Text, Y.Array, Y.XmlFragment`).
  - it can also be used to describe the current state of a sequence-like data structure
- The delta format is very powerful to express changes that are performed in a Transaction.
  - events are fired after transactions. With the delta format we can express multiple changes in a single event
