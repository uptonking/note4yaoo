- ## we've been working on a massive project to move the editor from Slate to ProseMirror in order to get everything working well on mobile.

  - I just successfully booted up the mobile app for the first time. Feels good!
- ProseMirror doesn't do weird stuff with preventDefault that stops Slate working on Android.
- I have gone through this exact migration, best of luck! You won't be disappointed with Prosemirror, it's a fantastic piece of software.
