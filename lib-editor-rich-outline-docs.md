- Outline allows you to organize documents in "collections", for example these could represent topics like Sales, Product, or HR. 
  - Within collections documents can be interlinked and deeply nested to easily build relationships within your knowledge base.
- You can start searching from anywhere with the CMD+K shortcut – then filter by time, author

- The heart of Outline is the document editor. 
  - If you’re comfortable writing markdown, then all of the shortcuts you are used to are supported
  - You can also paste markdown or html from elsewhere directly into a document.
  - The editor supports a variety of content blocks including images, tables, lists, quotes, videos, and more. 
  - Type "/" on an empty line or click on the "+" icon to trigger the block insert menu, you can keep typing to filter it down.

- Linking to another document automatically creates backlinks which are kept up-to-date and shown at the bottom of the document, 
  - so you can create a library of linked information and easily answer the question "which other documents link here?".
