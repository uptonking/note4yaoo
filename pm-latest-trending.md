- ## A new GitHub Issues is coming this Fall, with better ways to plan, track, and manage projects.
- https://twitter.com/github/status/1407731478096756739
  - https://github.com/features/issues
  - github的issues依靠用户量，要超越atlassian全家桶已经势不可挡了
- **features**
- kanban-board 与 table 无缝切换
  - 支持sort/filter/group
- issues to actionable tasks
  - 类似邮件的操作，支持多状态或进度的任务
- conversation/expression with gfm markdown
  - 支持mention、emoji reaction、attachment、references to commits/pr/releases、project milestone
- slice views
  - 从现有表格中提取数据
- keyboard shortcuts
  - Every action you can take with the mouse has a keyboard shortcut or command
- custom fields
  - like priority, dates, notes, links
- automate with code
  - codify your team's process, like auto add labels to issues
- Issues, wherever you look
  - Issues can be viewed, created, and managed in your browser/terminal/phone.
- Seems like GitHub is going to cover it all for us - from project planning to development to deployment. Excited for this release
- If you add time report and nice charts and reporting we would be glad to leave Jira
- Bookmarking this for the paper unfolding animation
  - We were inspired by "origami"(日本折纸艺术，折纸手工), because of the many ways you can setup a project table with custom fields. It felt like a canvas and folding paper to achieve different shapes.

- How does the animation unfold at the beginning of the video?
  - We were inspired by "origami" so the idea is that you are unfolding an issue.
- How sorting priorities are handled with labels? (Or any custom fields really) if e.g if we want to group by priority, but sorting with high priority coming first in the group and low priority coming down
  - Yep! You can group by one category, then sort by another.
- I hope it has some sync story with Jira so that our org can use it. Other parts of company deeply entrenched in Jira
- Any plans for better search, with full Boolean logic in queries? That is the one thing I would miss from Jira.
