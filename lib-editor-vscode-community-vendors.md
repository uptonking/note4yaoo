- TL; DR (meta phrased)
  - Microsoft is forking VSCode open source community by split licensing for source code and and official build of VSCode. If you build by yourself you can’t connect to VSCode is marketplace.
  - This allows them to fully control VSCode telemetry and reporting along with use on platforms such as Gitpod. It’s similar to how Apple controls apps on iPhone and in turn control how much you need to pay them

- lsp actually came out of the .net opensource community. omnisharp to be exact. It's funny how much is actually attributed to MS in this case, when most of VSCode did not originate there.
