- ## 

- ## Putting the finishing touches on my new Tree component. There are half a million fairly complex items in this demo
- https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1564010912822034434
- I like this tiny virtualized list implementation
  - https://github.com/developit/preact-virtual-list
- Is this position:absolute based virtualization?
  - Yeah he said that in a previous post

- Bare-bones and hacky implementation, but this is near-optimal virtualized list rendering on the web, while scrolling no nodes are created, destroyed or attached/detached/moved in the DOM, and no VDOMs are diffed. There's barely anything happening, just pure performance 
  - https://twitter.com/fabiospampinato/status/1562481426833977345
  - I optimized some internal details, now it does sub-millisecond scripting while scrolling, for a list containing half a million items. 
- 👉🏻 Are you doing something funky like position absolute changing on those 6 elements, so you don't need to key it?
  - Yeah exactly, here's a version with the "top" property animated, you can see items changing position. It's that plus rendering the same number of items all the time, plus reusing nodes if possible, plus keeping the order of nodes fixed, plus using Solid-like signals.
- I was always sad about having to remove recycling from Preact. It was clever and a huge performance win.
  - Why did this have to be removed?
  - It does unexpected things with any stateful DOM elements, like form inputs,      `<video>, <img>`, etc. Everything doing recycling runs into it eventually, just takes a while. Not a showstopper for some use-cases, but often makes for a confusing default.
- This is non-keyed isn't it. That's always the tradeoff with going hyper-optimized. Data swap on fixed nodes using reactive bindings. What's the hacky part?
  - Yeah it's 99% just a non-keyed `<For>` that keeps the same nodes around and updates the signals. The user code, at least for this very simple use case, looks identical to what one may write for a regular `<For>` though, so the performance is kinda hassle-free.
  - The hacky (mainly just ugly really) parts are: 
  - 1) I didn't think about the fact that `<For>` could return nodes in a different order, and that would trigger the diff function, which would mess up with the near-optimality, so I patched `<ForValue>` in Voby to sort results for now.
  - 2) I didn't realize that depending on the exact scrolling state the number of items visible could vary, like maybe you can fit exactly 10 25px items in a 250px container, but if two of them are partially visible then you can see 11 items. But I need the number to be constant.

- ## how browsers parse HTML – do most browsers start parsing parts of the html _as_ they are still downloading or they have to wait until the whole HTML document is completely downloaded?
- https://twitter.com/he_zhenghao/status/1534379242657660930
  - also is parsing-while-downloading html the same as streaming html? 
- HTML parsers are piped with the network stream on document downloads, but obviously not when using something like .innerHTML.
  - HTML streaming is about streaming HTML from the server as it is SSRed, instead of waiting for it to be fully SSRed before sending it. AFAIK.

- ##  `<img>` and background-image download images differently.
- https://twitter.com/iamakulov/status/1504804839921909761
  - `<img>` tag fetches an image as soon as HTML arrives.
  - background-image fetches it much later, only when all CSS files download (even if you specify `style="background-image: …"` straight in HTML).
  - To download a background-image, the browser has to figure out *which* image to download, first.

- ## Optimum `<head>` order for performance
- https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/1440697011985018881
- Putting the 'SEO' `meta` tags at the end of the `<head>` might be optimal for performance, it's actually very dangerous for SEO. The inclusion of scripts above those meta tags in the `<head>` increases the likelihood of search engines ignoring or improperly parsing the `meta` tags.
  - Google does indeed render in headless browsers, but not for all pages and definitely not faultlessly.
- Not all `<meta>` s should be at the top.
  - to avoid reparsing
  - since this is rendered separately, in the browser UI itself
  - since this affects layout
  - [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/dist/doc/html.md)

```html
<meta charset="utf-8"><!-- 1 -->
<title>…</title><!-- 2 -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"><!-- 3 -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css">
<-- everything else -->
```

- Preload of fonts should generally go before CSS if you’re reasonably confident the fonts will be used on the page. Improves waterfall, CLS, FOUT, etc. And yeah, I don’t think sync JS before sync CSS makes sense

- ## Avoid performance degradations during marketing campaigns by excluding these query strings from your (CDN) Cache Key: utm_*; fbclid; gclib
- https://twitter.com/TimVereecke/status/1439851763851579393
- Under actual traffic conditions
🎯 Better offload
🎯 Better TTFB performance 
- Or go the whole hog and select "Ignore all parameters". If your site doesn't rely on query params for driving content you'll get a very nice perf lift.

- ## How Chrome handles: `<script> in <head>` vs. `<script async>` vs. `<script defer>` vs. `<script> in <body>` ; 
- https://twitter.com/iamakulov/status/1439182424798232577
- [JavaScript Loading Priorities in Chrome](https://addyosmani.com/blog/script-priorities/)
  - Note: Loading priorities are not guaranteed to be consistent cross-browser so use this knowledge wisely and measure when unsure. 
  - Ideally, aim to delivery a great experience to the widest number of users possible.
  - If you're a web developer wondering where you can see the "Loading Priority", Chrome DevTools has an optional "Priority" column available in the Network panel. 

- ## Still using JPEG and PNG for images? 
- https://twitter.com/Steve8708/status/1400953776031285257
  - Consider using `<picture>` tags and WEBP for +30% faster loading images

- ## Spent some dev cycles over the last week working on some JS bundle improvements for @components_ai .
- https://twitter.com/4lpine/status/1382805903603163136
- Offloaded a lot of client heavy JS to API endpoints.
  - Main app serves 60% less JS
  - 80%+ reduction in large components
  - 50% improvement in build times
- The most fruitful optimizations boiled down to a few things:
  - Preprocessing large sets of data so we only send what's needed
  - Replacing large, inlined SVGs with CDN links (with caching)
  - Moving functionality requiring Babel/PostCSS/Prettier/etc. to API endpoints
- The #NextJS bundle analyzer plugin was super useful because it helped pinpoint problematic pages and modules.
  - From there it was preprocessing data and moving code around with a more clear separation between "front end" and "back end".

- ## Beyond junior, you need to understand performance of nested loops. You need to understand when to pick object vs array and what that means as your data grows. 
- https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1375495411746635781
  - You need to understand how to write functions so that computation can be cached.
  - That’s not what y’all are testing.

- ## I spent some time today working on the page-load experience of my course platform. 
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1375237480652345347
- Some of the changes:
  - SSR the code snippets instead of lazy-loading them and doing it all on the client
  - Get SSR styles working in MDX
  - Give things concrete heights to prevent CLS between spinner/loaded content
  - [Next + next-mdx-remote + styled-components](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1375133558734532619)
- I love how you put so much effort into all the details! Definitely learning a lot from your approach to our craft.

- ##  how to get a Core Web Vitals report in Google Data Studio. (It’s actually quick! Just clone a template and change the url.)

- ## The built-in Link component in @GatsbyJS prefetches the page you're about to click on so it can load even faster. 
- https://twitter.com/gill_kyle/status/1370478472699682819
  - This is the kind of runtime optimization I didn't even realize was happening

- ## When it comes to performance, it's so easy to focus exclusively on speed. The numbers matter, but they're not the only lever we can pull!
- https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau/status/1365333133252558850
  - A few years ago in an OSS project, we had a process that took 20+ seconds. 
  - We improved the _perceived_ performance by adding a mini-game!
  - I feel like this area is so under-explored on the web. 
  - We could learn a lot from video games, where loading screens are a fact of life, and developers have found clever ways to keep users engaged during that time.
  - if you're curious about that mini-game loader thing, you can view the code here
  - https://github.com/joshwcomeau/guppy/tree/master/src/components/WhimsicalInstaller
- Multi-stage loaders in general are great. 
  - Think about how much better a 3-step progress indicator feels vs. an opaque endless spinner.
- It's tricky since it's harder to measure perception. It's hard to make an OKR about something so qualitative! 
  - But we can measure the downstream effects. 
  - Instead of measuring load times, we can measure bounce rate, sales numbers, etc.
